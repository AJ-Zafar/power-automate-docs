# Manage cloud flows

Use the Power Automate mobile app for Android to view and run your flows, check their run history, turn them on and off, or delete them. You can manage your flows when you're away from your computer whether they're solution-aware or non-solution&ndash;aware. [Learn about solution-aware flows](../overview-solution-flows.md).

## View a list of your cloud flows

By default, the **Flows** screen shows all the flows that you've created.

To show flows that others have shared with you, select **Shared with me** at the top of the **Flows** screen.

## Run, delete, and turn a flow on or off

Select the vertical ellipsis (**...**) next to a flow, and then select one of the options: **Run flow**, **Turn off** (or if the flow is off, **Turn on**), or **Delete**.

You can also turn a flow on and off in the [**Details** screen](#view-run-history-and-details).

## View run history and details

Select the vertical ellipsis (**...**) next to a flow, and then select **Details**.

In addition to the flow's run history, you can view a description of the flow if one was provided, how long ago it was modified, and its type.

You can also toggle **Enable** here to turn the flow on or off.
