# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Restrict Requests for Microsoft Flow

## Introduction

As part of our commitment to partner with you on your journey to the GDPR, we’ve developed  documentation to help you prepare. The documentation not only describes what we’re doing to prepare for the GDPR but also shares examples of steps you can take today with Microsoft to support GDPR compliance when using  Microsoft Flow.

## Manage restrict requests
Data subjects may request that you restrict processing of their personal data.  We provide both  pre-existing application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs).  These experiences provide the enterprise customer’s tenant administrator the capability to manage such DSRs through a combination of data export and data deletion. A customer may (1) export an electronic copy of the personal data of the user, including (a) account(s), (b) system-generated logs, and (c) associated logs, followed with (2) deletion of the account and associated data residing within Microsoft systems.
