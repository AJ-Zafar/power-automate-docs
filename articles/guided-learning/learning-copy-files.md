# Copy files
Today, it's very common to use a **file storage service**, such as **OneDrive** or **Google Drive**.  Have you ever needed to **copy files from one storage service to another**?  Microsoft Flow makes it easy to automatically move and copy files between two services.

## Creating flows that copy files
You can **use a template**, like in the video above, or you can create a flow **from scratch**.  Different services have different details and parameters in their **actions**.  In the video, we showed you copying a file from **OneDrive** to **OneDrive for Business**.  Here's another example we created from scratch to copy from **OneDrive to DropBox**.

## Next steps
Next, we'll look at how you can **collect data** from services.
