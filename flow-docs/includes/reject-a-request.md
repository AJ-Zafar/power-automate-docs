You can reject a request via email, the approvals center, or the Power Automate app. To reject a request, follow the steps for approving a request, but select **Reject**, instead of **Approve**.

After you confirm your decision (rejection of the request), the flow runs the following steps:

1. Sends an email to the person who requested vacation.
2. Updates the SharePoint Online list with the decision, and the comments from the approver.
