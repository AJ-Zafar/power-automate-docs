# Use flows from with the Power Apps app in Teams

You can build flows to customize and add further value to Microsoft Teams from within the Power Apps app in Teams. 
You can create [instant](../introduction-to-button-flows.md), [scheduled](../run-scheduled-tasks.md), and [automated](../get-started-logic-flow.md) flows, with access to over 350 connectors. This includes a connector to work with [Project Oakdale Tables](/powerapps/teams/create-table) within Teams as well.

>[!NOTE]
>You need a [Power Automate license](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing/) to access all 350 connectors, including premium connectors. Users with a Microsoft 365 license can use all standard connectors.

## Prerequisites 

- The Power Apps app must be installed before you can create flows in Teams. For more information, [Install the Power Apps personal app in Teams](/powerapps/teams/install-personal-app).

- Before you can use the Power Apps app in Teams to create a flow, a Project Oakdale environment must already exist for that team. A Project Oakdale environment is automatically provisioned when you [create your first app in Teams](/powerapps/teams/create-first-app).

## Create a flow in Teams

1. Navigate to the **Build** tab in your Power Apps app, and then select **See all**.

1. Select **New**, and then select **Flow**.

   ![Create a flow](..\media\overview-teams-flows\new-flow.png)

1. The Power Automate designer opens, allowing you to create and save your flows.

   ![View of the designer](..\media\overview-teams-flows\designer.png)


You can only create three types of flows....


## Work with your flows

1. To find your saved flows, select **Build**, and then select **Flows** in the tree view. 

   ![All flows](..\media\overview-teams-flows\all-flows.png)

## Customize a flow

In Teams, you could have acquired flows from an installed app, or you may have created them yourself. You can update or customize either of these flows. To update your flow, select it from the recently updated list, or select **See all** > **flow**, and then select **Edit**.  

   ![Customize flows](..\media\overview-teams-flows\customize-flow.png)

## View details and run history

Select **Details** from the menu of the flow in which you are interested to see the run history and other details for your flows.
