Using this action, you can create a new record in Common Data Service.

For example, you can set up a flow to create a new Account in Common Data
Service when you receive an email to your signup address, as shown below.

After selecting an entity, new fields appear that allow you to set values for
specific fields. Mandatory fields are indicated with an asterisk (\*), and it is
not necessary to enter a value for optional fields.

If you do not see an attribute, you can click on **Show advanced options** at
the bottom of the card.

You can use outputs directly from previous triggers and actions in the **Dynamic
content** selector shown below, or modify them by building an **Expression** as
suggested in [Use expressions in flow
actions](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/use-expressions-in-actions/).
