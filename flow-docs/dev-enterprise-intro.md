# Microsoft Flow for enterprise developers, ISVs, and partners

As a developer, you can extend Microsoft Flow, enabling even more powerful solutions for organizations and customers.

## Microsoft Flow for enterprise developers

As an enterprise developer, empower your organization to build robust tailored solutions on Microsoft Flow:

- **Build custom connectors**: Develop custom connectors to connect to your organization's data and web services through Microsoft Flow. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/)

- **Build Azure Functions**: Craft Azure Functions to extend apps with custom server-side logic. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-flow-scenario)

- **Embed Microsoft Flow**: Embed Microsoft Flow directly into your website experiences to create integrated solutions, surfacing workflows or processes where people in your organization already do their work. [Learn more](embed-flow-dev.md)

## Microsoft Flow for ISVs and Microsoft partners

As a Microsoft partner or ISV, accelerate customer adoption by extending your products to integrate with your customers' data and business processes:

- **Build and certify custom connectors**: Bring your product into the Microsoft cloud by building a connector that enables Microsoft Flow to talk to your service. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/submit-certification)

- **Publish templates**: Once you have a connector, you should publish templates that demonstrate how to use your service. These templates will serve as examples that users can use to learn and then extend to their own unique workflows. [Learn more](publish-a-template.md)

- **Embed Microsoft Flow**: Embed Microsoft Flow within your app to enable deep, in-context integration between your app and all the other services that Microsoft Flow supports. [Learn more](embed-flow-dev.md)

- **List your solution on AppSource**: Generate new leads for your business by building an app and publishing it to AppSource for new customers to test-drive. [Learn more](dev-appsource-test-drive.md)
