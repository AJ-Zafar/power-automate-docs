# Manage an on-premises data gateway #
Install and manage an on-premises data gateway to securely integrate a variety of cloud-based apps with your on-premise data and applications through Microsoft Flow.

**Prerequisites**

- the user name and password that you used to [sign up](sign-up-sign-in.md) for Microsoft Flow
- administrative permissions on a gateway.

	You have these permissions by default for each gateway that you install, and an administrator of another gateway can grant you these permissions for that gateway.

## View accessible gateways ##
In the top header of [Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com), click or tap the **Account menu**, and then click or tap **My gateways**.

**Note**: If you've been granted access to a gateway in PowerApps, that gateway will also show up in this list.

## Install a gateway ##   
If you don't have a gateway, click or tap **Add a gateway** in the upper-right corner (or [download the installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820580&clcid=0x409) directly), and then run the installation wizard. Once you have registered and configured your gateway successfully, it should show up in this list. 

**Note**: Be sure to use the same credentials you use to sign in to Flow, to register your gateway.
