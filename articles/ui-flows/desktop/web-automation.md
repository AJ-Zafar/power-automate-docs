# Web automation

The flow designer includes a number of actions under the **Web Automation** category, each of them corresponding to an interaction between a user and a web browser.

Four web browsers are currently supported:

* Internet Explorer
* Edge
* Firefox
* Chrome

Web automation is achieved by launching, or attaching to, one of the aforementioned browsers, then performing web automation actions on them.
