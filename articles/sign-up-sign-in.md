# Signing up and Signing in for Microsoft Flow #

## Signing up for the first time ##

1. To sign up for Microsoft Flow, visit [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com) and select **Sign up free**.

2. Enter your work or school email address on and click go. You will be redirected to sign in with your work or school credentials.

If you haven’t used an online Microsoft product in the past, you may be redirected to first create an account for your work or school email before you can get started with Microsoft Flow. It’ll take just a few moments to create an account to get started.

### Why can’t I use my @gmail.com or @outlook.com address? ###

You are unable to use your personal email to use Microsoft Flow at this time. Instead, use an email address that has been provided to you by your work or school. If you’d really prefer to use your personal email, drop us a note and let us know why!

### Why do I have to walk through this sign up process to use the product? ###

If you haven’t used an online Microsoft product with your work or school account in the past, we need to create an account for you. This takes just a few moments and you’re be able to start using Microsoft Flow, and other Microsoft products.

## Signing in ##

Once you have Signed up for Microsoft Flow, you can select the **Sign in** button on [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com). You will be redirected to sign in with your work or school credentials. 

## Next steps ##

- [Start with a template](get-started-logic-template.md), which are pre-built flows that are set up for you.
- [Start from blank](get-started-logic-flow.md) if you already have a process in mind and can't find a template for it.
