# Managing the workspace toolbar

Drag and drop actions to rearrange them and change the order in which they run. Right click an action and select Enable or Disable to enable or disable an action respectively. While running, the flow skips any disabled actions. Hold down **Ctrl** and click to select multiple actions, or **Shift** and click the first and last actions to select a range of actions. Copy and paste any selected actions in the workspace. This can be done within the same subflow, among different subflows or other open instances of flow designer. When copying actions, all their parameters are copied as well. Right click on any action and select **Run from here** to start running the flow from the indicated action.
