# Guided Learning for the mobile app for Microsoft Flow

In this lesson, we will be covering the Flow Mobile App and its capabilities. We will go over The **Activity Feed**, **Browsing**, **Buttons** and **Managing Flows** from the app.

First, you’ll need to **download** and **install** the Microsoft Flow App from your app store.

![Activity Feed](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-open-mobile-app.png)

Once it's installed, **open it** up and **sign in**.

![Activity Feed](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-see-all-activity.png)


As we can see here, when you open the app, you land on the **Activity Feed**.

The Activity Feed is the spot to see what’s happening with your flows while you are on the go and may not have access to your computer for a full experience.

For instance, if you **click** any of these flows, you can get a **closer look** at that flows **last activity**, whether it succeeded or failed to run, and if it failed, which step it failed on.

![Last activity](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-activity-details.png)

As we can see here, this flow succeded in all three steps.
From here, go ahead and **click** the **Buttons** icon.

## How Flows are Kicked Off
   
   Buttons are flows that are kicked off with a manual action. For instance, one of my buttons is **Send a Working from Home email to your Manager**.
   You could use this one if you live far away and on days the traffic is a mess!


![last activity](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-click-browse-button.png)


Use the **Browse** button to check out templates for more button flows to add to your collection. 

Let’s go ahead and see how that works.

![ Choose send myself a reminder](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-send-a-reminder.png)

**Choose** the **Send myself a reminder in 10 minutes** button flow.


![Click Create](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-create-mobile-reminder.png)

And then, click **Use this template**.

![Saved flow](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-use-this-template.png)

and then click on **Create**.

![Saved flow](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-create-complete.png)

The flow is **saved**, 

![The flow is saved](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-complete-reminder.png)

**created**,

and here it is in your collection.

![In our buttons](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-button-send-reminder.png)

![In our buttons](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-in-your-collection.png)


Here it is in your buttons, and you can go ahead and **click it**, and in 10 minutes, you'll get a **reminder**.

See how simple it is to **add additional buttons** to your collection?
Now, what if you suddenly decide that you don’t want one of your Flows anymore?


![Buttons icon](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-click-flows-button.png)


**Click** on the **Flows** button which is essentially the mobile management area for your flows.



![Unwanted flow](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-send-a-reminder.png)

Now, **click** on this **flow** as you don’t really want this one anymore and we see that you have a few options.


![Enable or disable](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-here-it-is.png)

You can enable it or disable it by **pressing the Enable flow** toggle, and you can also delete it by **pressing the Delete** button.


![Run history](./media/learning-mobile-app/1-disable-delete.png)

You can **enable** or **disable** the flow on the go, you can edit the flow, in case you want to make it useful to yourself again, and you can see the **run history** of the flow to get an idea of its successful and unsuccessful runs.

## Next Lesson

In our next lesson, we will look at the **Create a Button** flow.
