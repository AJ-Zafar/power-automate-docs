# Create a flow in a solution


Flows you create in a solution are known as *solution-aware* flows. Follow these steps to create a solution-aware flow.

## Prerequisites

You need to have at least one solution before you can create a solution-aware flow.

## Create the flow 

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
1. Select **Solutions** from the navigation bar.

1. Select the solution in which you'll create your flow.

1. Select **New**, and then select **Flow**.

   Power Automate opens.

1. Use the available connectors and triggers to build your flow.

   In this example, we'll build a simple flow that sends a notification when an email arrives in your inbox.
1. Search for and then select **Office 365 Outlook**.
1. Select the **When a new email arrives (V3)** trigger.
1. Select **New step**.
1. Search for the word "Notification", and then select the **Send me a mobile notification** action.
1. Add the **Subject** dynamic token to the **Text** field of the **Send me a mobile notification** box.
1. Give your flow a name and then save the flow.

   Your flow should appear like this:

1. Select **Solutions** to see your flow in the solution:
