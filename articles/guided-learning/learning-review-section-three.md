# Review the third section

Let's review what we've learned in this section.

You can administer **Microsoft Flow** through two interfaces: 

* The **web portal** located at **flow.microsoft.com** provides a complete management experience, including the ability to create flows from **scratch** and from **templates**, view and troubleshoot **run history**, and administer **enterprise features**, such as **environments** and **data loss prevention**.
* The Microsoft Flow mobile app for [Android](https://aka.ms/flowmobiledocsandroid), [iOS](https://aka.ms/flowmobiledocsios), or [Windows Phone](https://aka.ms/flowmobilewindows) contains similar functionality. Additionally, the Microsoft Flow mobile app receives **push notifications** and has the ability to use **buttons** to manually trigger a flow.

## What's next?
Congratulations! You have finished the third section of Microsoft Flow Guided Learning. Next we'll look at enterprise features of Microsoft Flow.
