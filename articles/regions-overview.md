# Power Automate regions overview

In Power Automate, your flows are created within your Power Platform environment. These environments are specific to a region, which corresponds to the location of the datacenters where your Power Platform environment is stored.

In other words, your flows are deployed in the [datacenter region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) that hosts your [Power Platform environment](environments-overview-admin.md).

## More information about Power Platform environments

## Frequently asked questions

### How can I find out the region where my flow is deployed?

Administrators can identify the region by signing in to the Power Platform [admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). The **Environments** tab lists all existing environments and their regions.

### Is Power Automate available in national clouds?

Yes. [Learn more](./us-govt.md).

### What outbound IP addresses are used in each region?

See [Limits and configuration](limits-and-config.md).
