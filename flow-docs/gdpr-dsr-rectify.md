# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Rectify Requests for Microsoft Flow

If a data subject has asked you to rectify the personal data that resides in your organization’s data, you and your organization will have to determine whether it’s appropriate to honor the request.  Rectifying the data may include taking actions such as editing, redacting, or removing personal data from a document or other type or item. 

You may use Azure Active Directory to manage identities (personal data) of your end users in Microsoft Flow. Enterprise customers have the ability to manage DSR rectify requests, including limited editing features per the nature of a given Microsoft service.  As a data processor, Microsoft does not offer the ability to correct system-generated logs as it reflects factual activities and constitutes a historical record of events within Microsoft services.
