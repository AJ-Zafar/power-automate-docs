# Introduction to desktop flows 

Power Automate Desktop broadens the existing robotic process automation (RPA) capabilities in Power Automate and enables you to automate all repetitive desktop processes. It’s quicker and easier than ever to automate with the new intuitive Power Automate Desktop designer using the prebuilt drag-and-drop actions or recording your own desktop flows to run later. 

Leverage automation capabilities in Power Automate Desktop. Create flows, interact with everyday tools such as email and excel and work with modern and legacy applications. Examples of simple and complex tasks you can automate are: 

Quickly organize your documents using dedicated files and folders actions 

Accurately extract data from websites and store them in excel files using Web and Excel automation  

Leverage desktop automation capabilities to put your work on autopilot  

Power Automate Desktop is addressed to home users, small businesses or larger enterprise companies. It’s addressed essentially to everyone who is performing simple or complex rule-based tasks on their workstations 

In case you are a Home user who is accessing a weather website to see tomorrows forecast, or a self-employed businessman who extracts information from vendors invoices or even an employee of a large enterprise who automates data entry on an ERP system, Power Automate Desktop is designed for you. 

It allows you to automate both legacy applications, such as terminal emulators and modern web and desktop applications, Excel files, and folders. Interact with the machine using application UI elements, images, or coordinates.
