# Set up Power Automate Desktop

Before you can use your device to create desktop flows, you'll need to ensure it meets the requirements outlined here.

> [!TIP]
> Before you create a desktop flow, check the [list of connectors](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/) to see if the application you want to automate already has a connector. If it does, consider creating a cloud flow instead of a desktop flow. You might also build your [own connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/).

## Prerequisites

- Either a [paid](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing/) or [trial](https://flow.microsoft.com/manage/) license for Power Automate Attended RPA.

- A work or school account to sign into your Windows device with administrator privileges and Power Automate.

- System requirements:

   - A device that runs Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Entreprise, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2019.
      
      - Minimum hardware
         - Storage: 1GB
	      - RAM: 2GB
     - Recommended hardware
        - Storage: 2GB
	     - RAM: 4GB

- The [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) (version 80 or later)
    or Google Chrome browser.

- An [environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/environments-overview) with a [Microsoft Dataverse database](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-database).

- A supported keyboard attached.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have the latest versions of each component to record, test, or run desktop flows.

## Install Power Automate Desktop on your device

The installer contains all the components you need to record, edit, and test your automations. 

Follow these steps to install the Power Automate Desktop app:

1. [Download the Power Automate Desktop installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2102613).
1. Open the **Setup.Microsoft.PowerAutomateDesktop.exe** file. 

   This file is likely in your **Downloads** folder after you downloaded it in the previous step.

1. Follow the instructions in the **Power Automate Desktop setup** installer to complete the installation. 
1. Make your selections for each feature for the installation to complete. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The installer installs the Webdriver component. You need it to run desktop flows created with Selenium IDE.
>It will also installs the Power Automate Desktop app and third-party components.

### Set data collection options

During installation, you can change the default settings if you do not want to send usage data to Microsoft. To do so, uncheck **Allow Microsoft to collect usage data to improve Power Automate**.

## Install the Power Automate browser extension 

After the installation completes, you will need to install and enable the extension for Power Automate Desktop. This extension will allow you to record and run web actions in your desktop flows.

![Installation success image](../media/desktop-flows-setup/screen.png)

Select one of the links displayed in the installer. For example, if you want to record your web automations on Microsoft Edge, select the **Microsoft Edge** link.

   The store for your browser opens directly to the public page for the extension.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you already install the Power Automate extension in the past, you don't need to reinstall it

#### Microsoft Edge: 
- [Install Edge extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151411): select **Get**, and then select **Add extension** when prompted. 
- If you see the message: *This extension has been turned off in Microsoft Edge*, at the top of the page, select **Turn on extension**.

#### Google Chrome: 
- [Install Chrome extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2150929): select **Add to Chrome**, and then select **Enable extension** when prompted. 
- If you see the message: *This item has been disabled in Chrome* on top of the page, select **Enable this item**.

#### Mozilla Firefox:
- [Install Firefox extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151511): select **Add to Firefox**, and then select **Add** when prompted. 


> [!TIP]
> If you are not able to activate the extension(s) in your browser, you must use [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) (version 80 or later) or Google Chrome or Firefox. Other browsers are not suppoted. 

## Install the on-premises data gateway to run your desktop flows from the cloud

You will need the gateway to trigger your desktop from an [event, schedule, or button flow.](..\flow-types.md) on a remote device.

>[!TIP]
>The gateway isn't required if you only want to create, edit, and test your flows on your device.

[Install the on-premises data gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install), if you need it.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>When you install the gateway, it defaults to the region that Power Automate uses.


## Setup desktop flows connections and machine credentials

1. Sign into [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com).
1. Expand **Data** on the left side of the screen.
1. Select **Connections**.

   ![A screenshot of the connections tab](../media/desktop-flows-setup/connections-tab.png)

1. Select New connection.

   ![A screenshot of a connection](../media/desktop-flows-setup/new-connection.png)

1. Search for *Desktop flow*, and then select **Desktop flows**.

   <!-- ![A screenshot of the search box](../media/desktop-flows-setup/search-desktop-flow.png) -->

1. Provide the gateway information and device credentials: 

    - **Domain and Username**: Provide your device account. You can use a local account by using the name of the user (for example, “MACHINENAME\\User” or “local\\User”), or an Active Directory account such as “DOMAIN\\User”.
    - **Password**: Your account’s password.
    - **Choose a gateway**: Select the gateway you want to use.

      ![A screenshot that shows where to enter the credentials for the connection](../media/desktop-flows-setup/credentials-screen.png)

1. Select **Create**.

   ```

### Uninstall Power Automate Desktop using the command line

Use the following command to silently uninstall Power Automate Desktop:
   
   ```
   Setup.Microsoft.PowerAutomateDesktop.exe -Silent -Uninstall
   ```

### Update your version of Power Automate Desktop

>[!NOTE]
>All your data and configuration, including telemetry, shortcuts, etc. are retained when you update Power Automate Desktop. If you want to enable parameters previously disabled, you will need to first uninstall Power Automate Desktop, and then reinstall it. 

### Install the gateway with PowerShell Cmdlets

You will need the on-premises data gateway to trigger your desktop flows from a cloud flow.

You can use [PowerShell Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/gateway/overview?view=datagateway-ps) to install, configure, and manage your gateway.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To use PowerShell cmdlets, you will need to run them from PowerShell 7.0.0 or higher in an elevated session.

## Troubleshoot missing gateway

You might not find the gateway in the list while creating the connection for the following reasons:

- The gateway may be installed in a different region than your Power Automate region. To resolve this issue, uninstall the gateway from the device, and then reinstall it, selecting [the correct Power Automate region](../regions-overview.md#region-mappings-for-power-automate-and-gateways).
- The gateway was deleted by its owner.

## Install Windows recorder (v1) extension (optional)

The Windows recorder (v1) is another option to record and playback your desktop automations. We recommand you to use Power Automate Desktop since this is the latest RPA solution.

Follow these steps to install Windows recorder (v1) extension:

1. Install the extension on Micrsodt Edge and/or Google Chroome from the store (Firefox is not supported for Windows recorder (v1))

#### Microsoft Edge: 
- [Install Edge extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151412): select **Get**, and then select **Add extension** when prompted.

#### Google Chrome: 
- [Install Chrome extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2150930): select **Add to Chrome**, and then select **Enable extension** when prompted. 


## Install Selenium IDE to automate Web applications with desktop flows (optional)

The Selenium IDE is an open source tool that lets you record and playback human interactions on Websites.

With desktop flows, you can run Selenium IDE scripts from Power Automate and keep them stored securely (with appropriate IT governance) in Dataverse.

Follow these steps to install Selenium IDE:

1. Make sure you already installed and enabled Windows recorder (v1) extension (see previous section)

1. [Download and install](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2107665) the Selenium IDE for [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) (version 80 or later) or Google Chrome.

1. On Microsoft Edge (version 80 or later), select **Allow extensions from other stores**, and then select **Add to Chrome**.
