# Planning phase

Planning is the most important part in automating your process or task. When planning, you should consider the following:

- **What problem** will the process automation solve?

- **Who** will use the process automation?

- **What goals** and objectives will it meet for users?

Knowing the answers helps you stay on track when you design your process automation. It's easy to fall into the trap of *automating the process* as the objective, rather than
*solving the issue*.

The elements of planning your process automation is very similar to how you plan your app creation using Power Apps, such as:
- Identifying the business problem to solve (the use case)
- Deeply understanding the business process
- Optimizing the business process with your solution
- Deciding whether it's worthwhile to automate the process
- Creating a project plan

For detailed inoformation about each of these elements in the planning phase, read the planning section in Power Apps guidance content: [Planning phase](/powerapps/guidance/planning/planning-phase).

After reading the planning section in Power Apps guidance content, come back and continue reading the [Designing phase](process-design.md) in this guidance content.
