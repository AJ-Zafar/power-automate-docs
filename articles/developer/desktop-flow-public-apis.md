# Public API integration for desktop flows

As a developer, you can apply [desktop flows](/power-automate/desktop-flows/introduction) functionalities within your applications such as programmatically triggering and canceling a desktop flow.

Theses capabilities are offered as part of the Microsoft Dataverse platform.

## Prerequisites
1. Knowledge of [Dataverse Web API](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/perform-operations-web-api), [authentication with Dataverse](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/authentication) and [using OAuth with Dataverse](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/authenticate-oauth)
2. Knowledge of Dataverse environment and organization notions, and [how to retrieve the organization URL](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/discover-url-organization-web-api) manually or programmatically
3. Knowledge of [desktop flows notions](/power-automate/desktop-flows/run-pad-flow) and of what [connections are and how to create them](/power-automate/desktop-flows/install#setup-desktop-flows-connections-and-machine-credentials)

> [!NOTE]
> When following this documentation, all brackets [...] in URLs and input/output data should be replaced with values specific to your case.

## List available desktop flows
Desktop flows scripts are stored in Dataverse, as part of the [workflow entity](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/workflow).

Listing the desktop flows is done through listing workflows and filtering on the category.
### Example
##### Request
```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...
Accept: application/json

GET https://[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/workflows?$filter=category+eq+6&$select=name,workflowid&$orderby=name HTTP/1.1  
```
##### Response
```json
{
    "@odata.context": "https://[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/$metadata#workflows(name,workflowid)",
    "value": [
        {
            "@odata.etag": "W1069462",
            "name": "Desktop flow 1",
            "workflowid": "f091ffab-58bb-4630-a115-659453d56f59",
        },
        {
            "@odata.etag": "W1028555",
            "name": "Desktop flow 2",
            "workflowid": "eafba1a2-e8d4-4efa-b549-11d4dfd9a3d1",
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Desktop flows schema
If you need to retrieve the flow schema for inputs and/or outputs, you can use the clientData field for the target workflow.
##### Request
```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...
Accept: application/json

GET https://[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/workflows([Workflow Id])/clientdata/$value HTTP/1.1  
```

    }
}
```
## Retrieve status of a desktop flow run
Desktop flows runs are stored in Dataverse, as part of the [flowsession entity](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/flowsession).
### Example
##### Request
```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...
Accept: application/json

GET https://[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/flowsessions([Flow session ID])?$select=statuscode,statecode,startedon,completedon HTTP/1.1  
```
##### Response
```json
{
    "@odata.context": "https://[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/$metadata#flowsessions(statuscode,statecode,startedon,completedon)/$entity",
    "@odata.etag": "W1276122",
    "statuscode": 8,
    "statecode": 0,
    "startedon": "2022-06-16T12:54:40Z",
    "completedon": "2022-06-16T12:57:46Z",
}
```
#### Outputs
If the desktop flow has outputs, you can retrieve them by querying the outputs field.
##### Request
```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...
Accept: application/json

GET https://[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/flowsessions([Flow session ID])/outputs/$value HTTP/1.1  
```
##### Response
```json
{
    "Output1": "My output value"
}
```

## Trigger a desktop flow run (preview)
By using Dataverse, you can add the functionality of triggering a desktop flow through your application. To do this, you need to use the [RunDesktopFlow action](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/rundesktopflow).

To call the action, you'll need: 
- ID of the desktop flow to run (programmatic retrieval detailed in the [listing](#list-available-desktop-flows) section above)
  >[!TIP] 
  > Alternatively, you can retrieve the ID manually from the desktop flow details URL in the Power Automate portal. The URL format is: `https://flow.microsoft.com/manage/environments/[Environment ID]/uiflows/[Desktop Flow ID]/details`
  >
  > Refer to [Manage desktop flows](/power-automate/desktop-flows/manage) for more information.

- Name of the desktop flow connection to use (i.e which target machine/machine group to use for running your flow). The name can be retrieved from the URL of the said connection page in the Power Automate portal. The URL format is:  
`https://flow.microsoft.com/manage/environments/[Environment ID]/connections?apiName=shared_uiflow&connectionName=[Connection Name]`
  > [!NOTE]
  > See [Setup desktop flows connections and machine credentials](/power-automate/desktop-flows/install#setup-desktop-flows-connections-and-machine-credentials) for more info.

### Example
##### Request
```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...
Accept: application/json

POST https://[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/workflows([Workflow ID])/Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.RunDesktopFlow HTTP/1.1  
{
    "runMode": "attended",
    "runPriority": "normal",
    "connectionName": "[Connection Name]",
    "timeout": 7200,
    "inputs": "{\"Input1\":\"Value\", \"Input2\":\"Value\"}"
}
```
##### Response
```json
{
    "@odata.context": "https://[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/$metadata#Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.RunDesktopFlowResponse",
    "flowsessionId": "d9687093-d0c0-ec11-983e-0022480b428a"
}
```
### Errors
When an error occurs, the response will have a different format matching Dataverse error messages. The http error code and the message should provide enough information to understand the issue. Example:
```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

{
    "error": {
        "code": "0x80040220",
        "message": " Principal user (Id=526..., type=8) is missing prvReadworkflow privilege (Id=88...*)‚Äù
    }
}

```
