# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Rectify Requests for Microsoft Flow

## Introduction

As part of our commitment to partner with you on your journey to the GDPR, we’ve developed  documentation to help you prepare. The documentation not only describes what we’re doing to prepare for the GDPR but also shares examples of steps you can take today with Microsoft to support GDPR compliance when using  Microsoft Flow.

## Manage rectify requests
If a data subject has asked you to rectify the personal data that resides in your organization’s data, you and your organization will have to determine whether it’s appropriate to honor the request.  Rectifying the data may include taking actions such as editing, redacting, or removing personal data from a document or other type or item. 
You may use Azure Active Directory to manage identities (personal data) of your end users in Microsoft Flow. Enterprise customers have the ability to manage DSR rectify requests, including limited editing features per the nature of a given Microsoft service.  As a data processor, Microsoft does not offer the ability to correct system-generated logs as it reflects factual activities and constitutes a historical record of events within Microsoft services.
