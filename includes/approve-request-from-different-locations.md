If you're an approver in an approval flow, you receive an email whenever someone creates a request. The approval request is also sent to the approvals center. You can then approve or reject requests from the email, the approvals center, or the Microsoft Flow app.

To approve a request:

### From email

1. Select **Approve** from the email you receive when an item is added to the SharePoint Online list.

     Note: If you're using an Android or iOS mobile phone with the Microsoft Flow app installed, the Microsoft Flow app launches, otherwise, the approvals center opens in your browser.
