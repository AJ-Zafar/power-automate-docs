# Overview of using flows in Microsoft Teams

## Working with flows

You can build flows to customize and add further value to Microsoft Teams from within the Power Apps Teams app. 
Customers can create **Instant**, **Scheduled**, and **Automated** flows from within, with access to over 350 connectors. This includes a connector to work with Tables within Teams as well!  
Note: You need a [Power Automate license](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing/) to access all 350 connectors, including premium connectors. Users with a Microsoft Office license can use all standard connectors.

## Create a flow in Teams

1. Navigate to the **Build** tab in your Power Apps app, select **New**, and then select **Flow** as shown in the following image.

1. The Power Automate designer opens, allowing you to create and save your flows.

## Customize a flow

In Teams, you could have acquired flows from an installed app, or you may have created them yourself. You can update or customize either of these flows. To update your flow, select it from the recently updated list, or select **See all** > **flow**, and then select **Edit**.

## View details and run history

Select **Details** from the menu of the flow in which you are interested to see the run history and other details for your flows.
