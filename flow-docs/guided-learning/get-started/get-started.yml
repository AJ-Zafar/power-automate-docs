    Welcome to Guided Learning for Microsoft Flow. This **self-paced online course** explains Microsoft Flow in a sequential way so that you can build your knowledge from the ground up. The course is designed to provide **guidance in understandable chunks** with lots of **visuals and examples**, following a logical progression to help you learn principles and details.
    
    In this course, you'll learn about Microsoft Flow and its concepts, see how to **build flows**, **manage them**, and **administer them** in your environment. You'll be presented with information and scenarios for a fictional company called Contoso Flooring, but you'll see how to use the same scenarios in your business or your clients' businesses.
    
    If you're a beginner with Microsoft Flow, this course will get you going. If you already have some experience, this course will tie concepts together and fill in the gaps. This course is a work in progress, so **please let us know how we're doing** and what other topics you want to see in this course.
    
    ## What is Microsoft Flow?
    Microsoft Flow is an online **workflow service** that enables you to work smarter and more efficiently by **automating workflows** across the most common apps and services. For example, you can create a flow that adds a lead to **Dynamics 365** and a record in **MailChimp** whenever someone with more than 100 followers tweets about your company.
