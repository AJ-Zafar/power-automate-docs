# Start to build with Microsoft Flow #
Extend Microsoft Flow in these ways, among others:

- create and connect to a custom API
- share that API with all users of Microsoft Flow
- embed the flow experience from within an app
- leverage all the developer APIs so that users can interact with Microsoft Flow in the best way for them

**Prerequisites**

- An account on [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com)
- Office 365 credentials

## Create a custom API ##
Create a custom API, and then [register it](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/register-custom-api/) so that it can contribute to a larger experience.

## Share a custom API with all Microsoft Flow users ##
After you fully test your API, start the review process by sending this information to flowdev@service.microsoft.com.

- A swagger file that represents your API
- An icon for your connector
- A description of your API
- Approximately 10 ideas for how your API could benefit other users through templates

## Embed a flow ##
Embed Microsoft Flow from within your app to enable deep integration between it and all the other services that Microsoft Flow supports. You can use these APIs:

- Create/Read/Update/Delete operations on a flow
- Read operation on the list of flow templates

Send mail to flowdev@service.microsoft.com for more information about how to embed Microsoft Flow within an app.
