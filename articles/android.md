# Use the beta version of Power Automate mobile for Android (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Experience the same familiar look and feel of the Power Automate portal with the beta version of Power Automate mobile for Android. If you've used the previous mobile version, you'll notice some improvements, such as quicker response times and easier navigation.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
> - This article only applies to the beta version of the Power Automate mobile app for Android devices. If you want to use the Power Automate mobile app versions generally available across different platforms, refer to the previous articles in this section.

## Install the beta version

Before you can install the beta version, the Power Automate app must be installed on your device.

To download the beta version:

1. Tap **Play Store**. Depending on the version of your device, the icon might be named Google Play Store.

1. In the search bar at the top, enter **power automate**.

1. Tap **Power Automate** to open the app page.

1. Swipe to the bottom of the page until you reach the **Join the beta** heading.

1. Tap **Join**.

## Run instant flows

You can run your instant flows in the beta version. Instant flows allow you to easily run repetitive tasks from any place, at any time with your mobile device. Running instant cloud flows are automated, which saves you time. You might also encounter fewer errors than if you performed the tasks manually.

If you've used the previous Power Automate mobile version, you know instant flows as *button* flows.

For quick and easy access to your instant flows, you have the option to create a widget as a shortcut on your mobile device’s home screen.

## Manage approvals

The beta version allows you to view and respond to approvals while you’re away from your desk.

## Send and receive push notifications

You can send and receive push notifications in the beta version. You can also view a list of recent notifications and flow alerts from a notification bell. If you've used the previous Power Automate mobile version, you know these as *Activity Feeds*.

## View a list of your cloud flows

In the beta version, you can view the flows that you've created. This includes non-solution and solution-aware flows.

You can also view the details (for example, connections and run history) of an individual flow.

## Limitations

- Downloading the preview version of the app will overwrite the existing version of the Power Automate mobile app if you already have it downloaded on your mobile device.

- This feature is being rolled out and depending on your region, it may not be available for your tenant yet.

- The beta version doesn't support geofencing (location-based trigger).

- The beta version doesn't support flow creation and editing in this version; customers told us that they prefer to create and edit in the portal.

    If you need to create or edit on the go, you can always log in to Power Automate on your mobile’s browser.
