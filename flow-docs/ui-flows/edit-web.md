[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

[!INCLUDE [view-pending-approvals](../includes/cc-rebrand.md)]


Web UI flows automate websites running in the [next version of Microsoft

## Accessing a property of an object variable or item of an array variable**

This advanced capability lets you use syntax like \${foo.bar} to access the bar property of the foo object. You can also write to the bar property of foo by using foo.bar as the value property in a store commands. You can also use syntax such as \${foo[0]} to access the item in specific index of foo array.
