## Getting started with Google cognitive actions

Google cognitive services allow users to process unstructured data through machine learning and simplify complicated tasks like text analyzing and computer vision.

This functionality can be implemented in your desktop flows through the Google cognitive group of action. 

All Google cognitive actions require an API key that authorizes you to use the respective services. You can manage your API keys in the **APIs & services** section of the Cloud Console.
