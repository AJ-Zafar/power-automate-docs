# Submit a template to the Power Automate gallery

Submit a cloud flow template to the gallery of templates for Power Automate. Templates help people not only to create flows more easily, but also to imagine additional scenarios that would benefit from a cloud flow.

1. On the left pane, select **My Flows**.

1. Select a cloud flow, and then select the **More commands** (...) icon.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Screenshot of the More commands icon.](./media/publish-a-template/ellipsis-button.png "More commands icon")

1. On the menu that appears, select **Details**.

1. On the menu at the top, select **Submit as template**.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Screenshot of the Submit as template menu option.](./media/publish-a-template/context-menu.png "Submit as template menu option")

   You can only submit flows that have run successfully at least once since the last save. If your flow doesn't meet this requirement, you'll get a warning message.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Screenshot showing warning message of no successful runs.](./media/publish-a-template/need-successful-run-warning.png "Warning message of no successful runs")

1. Specify a meaningful title, a clear description of the scenario that your template will help automate, the biggest benefit, the number of users, number of runs, and the categories that apply for the template.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Screenshot of template options.](./media/publish-a-template/template-options.png "Template options")

1. Select **Submit**.

     The Power Automate team verifies and *possibly modifies* your template. If the team approves your template, it appears in the gallery of templates for Power Automate.

>[!NOTE]
>Templates are for use in the public gallery only. They are not supported for private use.
