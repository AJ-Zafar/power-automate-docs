# The status bar

The status bar on the bottom of the Window shows the status of the flow, the number of selected actions, and the total number of actions and subflows in the current flow. The Run delay shows the amount of time that the flow waits for after running each action in Flow designer. Select the delay and use the slider to adjust the value in milliseconds to change this value. The status bar also shows the number of Errors, if any are present, and selecting the Errors pops up the Errors pane. Using **Search inside code** shows an additional element with the number of results. Select this to pop up the Find in code pane.
