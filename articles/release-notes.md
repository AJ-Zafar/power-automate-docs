# Release notes #

## Preview features ##
If you used Logic flows as part of [Microsoft PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com), the Microsoft Flow Preview release offers several new features:

- You can now browse a gallery of dozens of templates and sort by Popularity, Name, or Date published.
- You can [publish your own templates](publish-a-template.md) into the gallery after you customize a flow.

- You can see the history for every check and run of your flow.
- When you save a flow, you can [watch it in action immediately](see-a-flow-run.md) by just performing the trigger action.
- We have a [new community](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=787467) for you to discuss Flow or [submit your ideas](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=787474).

## Known issues ##
1. When you use certain templates (such as those that use **Dynamics**, **SharePoint**, or **Salesforce**), the parameter tokens in the text boxes don't render properly. If you save the flow and re-open it, they should render.

2. When you view the history of a flow and try to leave the page, you'll be prompted for unsaved changes even if you haven't made any.

3. There is no button to add a custom API. However, if you add a custom API on [powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com), you can use it in Microsoft Flow.
