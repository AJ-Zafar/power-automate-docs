# Flow designer

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Flow designer contains all the tools required to design and debug a flow. Additionally, any images, UI elements, or variables of a flow can be accessed and managed.

The flow designer consists of multiple elements. The actions pane, the variables pane, and the workspace display information about the status of the flow, and all the data it contains. Subflows are separated into tabs to help design large, complex flows.  Tools for debugging flows, such as breakpoints and the option to run a flow step by step, are also available in flow designer. Any error information is displayed, and the erroneous actions are immediately highlighted.
