# Overview of flows with Microsoft Forms

Connectors serve as a way to connect to a service from Microsoft Power Platform. There are numerous types of form connectors available, including the [Microsoft Forms](/connectors/microsoftforms/) connector. Microsoft Forms is a new part of Office 365 Education that allows teachers and students to quickly and easily create custom quizzes, surveys, questionnaires, registrations, and more. You can follow these instructions to create a Microsoft Form.

Here's a video about Microsoft Forms.<br/>

## Microsoft Forms trigger
A trigger is the event that starts the flow. For example, Here's the Microsoft Forms trigger.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Microsoft Forms trigger screen.](..\media\forms\forms-trigger.png "Microsoft Forms trigger in Power Automate")

## Microsoft Forms action
Actions are the events you want the workflow to do once the trigger takes place. Here's the Forms action. The trigger doesnâ€™t contain dynamic content that includes all of the responses, so you always need to use **When a new response is submitted** with Get response details.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Microsoft Forms action screen.](..\media\forms\forms-action.png "Microsoft Forms action in Power Automate")
