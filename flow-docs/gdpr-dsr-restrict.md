# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Restrict Requests for Microsoft Flow

Data subjects may request that you restrict processing of their personal data.  We provide both  pre-existing application programming interfaces (APIs) or user interfaces (UIs).  These experiences provide the enterprise customerâ€™s tenant administrator the capability to manage such DSRs through a combination of data export and data deletion. A customer may (1) export an electronic copy of the personal data of the user, including (a) account(s), (b) system-generated logs, and (c) associated logs, followed with (2) deletion of the account and associated data residing within Microsoft systems.
