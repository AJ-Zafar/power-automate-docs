# Send and receive push notifications in the Power Automate mobile app for Android

The notifications feature allows you to send and receive push notifications. To get to the **Notifications** screen, tap the bell icon in the app header.

When you tap the bell icon, you'll see a list of recent notifications and flow alerts. If you've used the previous Power Automate mobile app version, you know this as Activity Feed.
