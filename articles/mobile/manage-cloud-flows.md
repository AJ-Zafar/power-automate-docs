# Manage cloud flows

Power Automate mobile allows you to view the flows you've created. This includes non-solution and solution-aware flows.

## View a list of your cloud flows

You can view the flows that you've created as well as flows shared with you. This includes non-solution, solution-aware, and shared flows.

You can view details of each individual flow, such as the flow description, most recent run history, and connections. You can also turn the flow on or off.
