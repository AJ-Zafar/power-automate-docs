# Export and import your process

You can copy or move process advisor processes from one environment to another using Microsoft Power Platform solutions. You need to be an owner or co-owner of a process to be able to export it.

 To learn more about solutions from Power Platform, see [Overview of solution-aware flows](overview-solution-flows.md).

## Export a process

1. Sign into [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/). Make sure you have selected the environment where the process you want to export has been created.

1. Select **Solutions** in the navigation pane on the left.

1. In the list, select the solution you want to use to add your process, or create a new solution and select it.

1. Select **Add existing** > **PM Inferred Task**.

1. Search for and select the process you want to export, and then select **Add**.

1. You can now export your solution and import it in another environment.

For more information about solution export, see [Export a solution](export-flow-solution.md).

## Import a process

To import a process into another environment:

1. Make sure you have exported your process with a solution.

1. Go to the environment where you want to import your process.

1. Follow the instructions in [Import a solution](import-flow-solution.md).
