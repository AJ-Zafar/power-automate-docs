# Data tables

A data table contains data in a tabular form. It is the equivalent of a two-dimensional array in programming terms. 

A data table contains rows and columns, and each item stored in the data table can be retrieved through its unique row and column number. Data tables can be considered as lists that contain other lists as items.

There is no direct way to create a data table, but two actions generate a data table as output: the **Read from Excel** action and the **Execute SQL statement** action.

To retrieve a specific item of a data table, use the following notation: **%VariableName\[RowNumber\]\[ColumnNumber\]%**

For example, to access the first row's second cell of a read Excel file, use the epxression of the image below. Keep in mind that the the **RowNumber** and the **ColumnNumber** should be 0 for the first item (row or column).

If you loop through a data table with a **For Each** action, the variable that will contain the current iterationâ€™s data is considered to be a data row.
