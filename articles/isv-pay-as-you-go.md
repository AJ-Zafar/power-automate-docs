# Power Automate embed pay-as-you-go

<!--todo: Rakesh, in the opening sentence, you refer to 'Power Automate ISV Embed PayGo', and you use 'Microsoft Cloud Embed program' later in this article. Did you mean to use 'Microsoft Cloud Embed program' in the opening sentence? -->
With Power Automate ISV embed pay-as-you-go program, independent software vendors (ISVs) can integrate Power Automate into their solutions, making it frictionless for their customers to use premium capabilities in their own flows. With this program, ISVs make their premium connectors available to all Power Automate makers and pay for these makers' consumption of of these connectors through [pay-as-you-go meters](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/news/powerautomate_payg_pricing).

Since ISVs pay for their customers' use of their premium connectors, there's no need for their customers to purchase standalone Power Automate licenses to build and run flows with the premium capabilities that the ISV offers.

You can learn more about the ISV Cloud Embed program here. <!--todo: deon to decide what to do with this sentence, based on response from PM about using the 'Microsoft Cloud Embed program'-->

With this approach, ISVs with premium connectors on Power Platform can make them available to any Power Automate user. After the ISV starts their participation in this embed program, users without premium licenses can build premium flows with connectors that the ISV provides. This enables any user to leverage the premium capabilities of Power Automate and build flows to enhance the products that they use from that ISV .

As customers build and run flows with these premium connectors, Microsoft sends aggregate tenant-level usage reports (flow runs involving these connectors) to the ISVs. No user data is shared as part of this program.

>[!NOTE]
>If a customer already has premium Power Automate licenses, the ISVs aren't billed for their consumption, and no aggregated usage reports are shared with the ISVs.

If an ISV discontinues their participation in the program, customers get advanced notice to acquire a paid Power Automate license to keep their flows running.

<!-- Rakesh: I am happy to include a list of the partners who are in this program. Have you thought about how this list will be maintained? Is there an automated way that someone can be notified when partners join or leave this program so that this list can be updated? I ask because I know Microsoft has been accused of favoritism when/if it appears that we are not listing all businesses/partners on an equal playing field.

<!--Rakesh, our style guidelines ask us to use the term ISV only we are referring to organizations that are truly ISVs. The preferred terms are "partner" or "provider" instead of "ISV". Do we consider organizations that create connectors as partners/providers/ISVs? -->
