# Respond to an approval from a chat or channel

If a user sends you an approval in a chat or channel message or using the approvals app. You can respond to it directly from within Teams from the chat or channel you received the approval in or the Approvals app.

Note that the approvals app will also show you any approval that was sent using a flow in the same environment as well. This way you can use the Approvals app in Teams to manage all your approvals in a single place.
