# Conclusion

By taking advantage of known and proven SAP recording techniques, combined with the latest and greatest cloud and desktop automation authoring in Power Automate, we were able to build an end-to-end SAP RPA prototype in less than an hour! Of course, we've only looked at the happy path for this use case, but it already includes some important security best practices and recording tips and tricks.

Now that you understand the basics of using Power Automate to automate SAP, you can use the [Power Automate documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/) and best practices guidance (including our [Automate It!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EewwUkXv33E&list=PLi9EhCY4z99UlSA7ykeZtSLraL8qlhFeq) video series) to automate your most frequent, mundane, and rule-based tasks.
