# Create an environment variable with SAP connection parameters (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

SAP has multiple connection parameters, and manually entering the parameters into each Power Automate cloud flow action can be time consuming. The preview SAP Integration solution available for [download](https://github.com/jongilman88/PowerPlatformSAPIntegration) includes an environment variable JSON string template for entering all of your SAP system information. Once your environment variable is defined, you can reuse it in your SAP actions without having to reenter it again.

## Define the environment variable

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) to [create an environment variable in a solution](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/environmentvariables#create-an-environment-variable-in-a-solution).
1. Select **Solutions** in the left navigation panel.
1. Open the **SAP Integration** solution.
1. On the command bar, select **New** > **More** > **Environment variable**
1. Complete the fields in the Environment variable panel.
    - **Display name**. Enter a name for the environment variable.
    - **Name**. This is automatically generated, but you can change it.
    - **Data Type**. Select **Text** (_do not_ select JSON).
      - Enter a JSON blob with a combination of SAP properties. Not all properties are necessaryâ€”your SAP environment will determine which ones are applicable. Refer to the SAP property guidance.

## Use the environment variable in a flow

Environment variables can be used in solution cloud flows since they are available in the dynamic content selector.

 For more information: [Use environment variables in Power Automate solution cloud flows](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/environmentvariables#use-environment-variables-in-power-automate-solution-cloud-flows)

### Known issue

If an environment variable is updated after it has been used in a flow, the updated values will not be used the next time the flow runs. The _flow must be edited or re-saved_ for the updated values in the environment variable to take effect.
