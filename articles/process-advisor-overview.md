# Overview of Process Advisor (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Process Advisor records and analyzes your manual business tasks. It discovers inefficiencies and shows optimization and automation opportunities. For example: in a healthcare facility, you could use Process Advisor to record patient check-in procedures. Process Advisor automatically produces a process map that visualizes the check in process, showing what activities take the longest, how many variations of the check-in process there are, and what variations and actions take the most time.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using Process Advisor, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. A Power Platform environment with Microsoft Dataverse database
    - For information about how to create environment, see: [Create and manage environments in the Power Platform admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-environment)
    - For information about how to add database to environment
1. Access to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/)
