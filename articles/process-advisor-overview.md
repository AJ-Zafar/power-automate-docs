# Overview of Process Advisor (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## What is Process Advisor?

Process Advisor records and analyzes your manual business tasks. It discovers inefficiencies and shows optimization and automation opportunities. For example: in a healthcare facility, you could use Process Advisor to record patient check-in procedures. Process Advisor automatically produces a process map that visualizes the check in process. You can see which activities take the longest, how many variations of the check-in process there are, and what variations and actions take the most time. Using this information and the powerful features in Process Advisor, you can drive improvements to make a difference for business.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using Process Advisor, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Power Platform environment with Microsoft Dataverse database
  - For information about how to create environment, see: [Create and manage environments in the Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/create-environment)
  - For information about how to add database to environment, see [Add a Microsoft Dataverse database](/power-platform/admin/create-database)
- Access to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/)
- [Power Automate Desktop](/ui-flows/desktop/introduction)
  - Make sure you have a UI Flows license. To start a trial license, select your default environment, and access flow.microsoft.com/manage/uiflows. If you don't have a license yet, you will be prompted to start your trial license.
