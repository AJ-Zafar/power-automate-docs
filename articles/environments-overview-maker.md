# Choosing an environment

When you create a Flow, you can choose which environment to host the flow. For example, you are creating a new Flow. This new flow will need to be tested. In this scenario, you can create your flow in a *Dev/Test* environment.

When this new flow has been tested, and is ready to be used publicly, you can then create this flow in a different environment. 

This topic shows you how to create a flow in different environments. 

## Create the flow

1. Open [flow.microsoft.com](http://flow.microsoft.com).
2. In the top right corner, select your user icon. The drop-down shows your current environment.
3. Select **change**, and then select the environment you want. 

Now create your flow. 

## Switching environments

Flow makes it pretty easy to switch between environments. When you do switch, you are seeing all the items in that specific environment; you are not seeing items in any other environment. 

Here's an example. 

You create a flow named *NewMember* in the *Sandbox* environment. In [flow.microsoft.com](http://flow.microsoft.com), you open the *Dev/Test* environment. The *NewMember* flow is not listed. To see the *NewMember* flow, open the *Sandbox* environment.

This applies to any items you create in the environment, including connections, gateways, PowerApps, and more.
