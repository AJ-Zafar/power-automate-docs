# Introduction

Microsoft Power Platform will be introducing enhanced integration capabilities into complex systems of record, like SAP and Oracle E-Business Suite. The enhanced integrations into Power Apps, Power Automate, and Azure Logic Apps will empower organizations to interact with complex systems of record more easily and build better end-to-end business solutions.

# Overview

During this private preview, we will assign a Power Automate contact to work with you to set up a new prebuilt SAP solution for either purchase orders or sales orders and connect to your SAP development environment to validate functionality. Your feedback will enable our team to gain more insights to make further improvements. Specifically, the goal is to set up and test the following:

-   Power Apps template for either purchase orders or sales orders

-   Enhanced Power Platform SAP connector

-   Power Automate SAP RFC Read Table query action

-   Azure Logic Apps functions

**Get started**

Let's work together to ensure a successful private preview rollout.  Your Power Automate contact is available to assist you along the way.  Please set up a meeting schedule with them.

## Resources 

Secure the following resources to assist with the configuration of the different environments: 

-   Information Technology (IT) System admin 

-   SAP Basis admin 

-   Flow maker (a resource with Power Platform familiarity) 

## Provisions

Our team has set up the following to make sharing and collaboration efficient:

 

-   Microsoft Teams setup – Use this space to share information and communicate with your Power Automate contact.  

-   Provide the names and email addresses of the resources who should be added to the Teams setup. 

-   Private preview files 

    -   Prebuilt SAP Solutions reference document 

    -   Private preview version of on-premises data gateway (OPDG) 

    -   A sales order or purchase order template—let your power automate contact know which template you prefer. 

    -   More, as needed.
