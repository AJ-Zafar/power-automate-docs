# Create an environment variable with SAP connection parameters (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

SAP has several different connection parameters, and it is cumbersome to have to enter these into each Power Automate cloud flow action. You can now create an environment variable in Power Apps that contains all of the SAP system information. Once the environment variable is defined, you can use the environment variable in your SAP actions without having to re-enter all the system information again.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2208506>)
1. [Create an environment variable in a solution](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/environmentvariables#create-an-environment-variable-in-a-solution). 

## Review connection references in flows

Once you have imported the SAP Integration solution into Power Apps and create environment variables with SAP connection parameters, you will need to sign in to Power Automate to review your connectors in the cloud flows. 

When you see the warning symbol in a connector, it means the environment variables did not map to the connection. You will need to to add user- and system-level connection references manually.

The following steps will walk you through this process:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2208508>).
1. In the left navigation panel, select **Solutions**.
1. Select the  **SAP Integration** solution.
1. In the left navigation panel, select **Cloud flows**.
1. Select a flow.
1. Go to the command bar and click **Edit**. You will be able to see the flow.
1. Select the connectors in the flow with the warning sign to add your user- and system-level connection references.
