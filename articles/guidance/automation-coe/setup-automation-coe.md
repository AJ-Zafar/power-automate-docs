# Setup Automation CoE Toolkit

## Setup Checklist

This is a checklist for initially setting up the Automation CoE Toolkit. **Use this checklist with the below docs.**

### Prerequisites

- Admin account with a premium license. <!--todo: link to the prem licenses-->
- An environment named **main**, for example, "orgname_Main"). <!--todo: this isn't clear, should the env be called "main" or must it have "main" in the name-->
- Configured Azure Key Vault.

### Import the main solution

- Import **AutomationCoEMain_x_x_x_x_managed** into your **main** environment.
- Provision the approvals solution (optional). <!--todo: what are the steps to do this?-->
- Confirm all flows in the solution are turned on.
- Assign security roles. <!--todo: assign these roles to whom?-->
- Share the apps with appropriate users. <!--todo: who are the "appropriate users--> 

### Import the satellite solution

- Create Azure AD app registration (Dataverse API) for each satellite.
- Define satellite environments (new or existing).
- Create application users in all satellite environments.
- Import AutomationCoESatellite_x_x_x_x_managed.
- Configure environment variables.
- Confirm all flows in the solution are enabled.
- Share the app with appropriate users. <!--todo: who are the "appropriate users--> 

### Define configuration data

<!--todo: this section is vague-->
- General data configured; ROI data configured; Console data configured
- Flow Exception Rules Framework

## Setup Main

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Perform all steps with the **Auto CoE Admin** account that's mentioned in the prerequisites.

### Import the main solution into the main environment

1. Create an environment in which to set up the CoE.
    1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
    2. Select Environments > + New, and then enter a name, type, and purpose.
    3. Select **Yes** to create the database, and then select **Next**.
    4. Keep sample apps and data set to **No**.
    5. Select **Save**.
1. Go to your new environment.
    1. Go to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/).
    2. Go to the environment you just created in which the main solution will be imported. For this example, we're importing to the environment named **Contoso_Main**.

      ![A screenshot that displays the environments](media/c4670e71d1b2fd29fbae6676e1037f47.png)

1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.
1. Select **Import**, and then **Browse**.
1. Select the Automation CoE main solution (**AutomationCoEMain_x_x_x_x_managed.zip**).
1. After the compressed (.zip) file loads, select **Next**.
1. Review the information, and then select **Next**.
1. Establish connections to activate your solution. If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.
1. Select **Import**.

   The import process can take 5-10 minutes to complete.

1. After importation completes, verify that all the flows are **turned on** and share the apps with the appropriate users.

   ![Screenshot that shows all flows are turned on](media/b8dae15259f4d787c09136d5fb849526.png)

### Provision the approvals solution (optional)

This step is optional. The only reason for doing this step is to speed up the setup process.

In new environments, Power Automate approvals isn't configured by default. After Power Automate initiates an approval, the approvals solution gets created.

This process usually takes 5-10 minutes. So, we can easily do this step while the main solution is being imported.

1. Go to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

   This is where the main solution is being imported.

1. Select the **My flows** tab on the left > **New flow** > **Instant cloud flow**.
1. Under the button trigger, add the **Start and wait for approval** action to the flow.
1. Fill in your details to trigger the flow.

   Here is an example of how you can configure the **Start and wait for approval** action.

   ![A screenshot that displays the start and wait for an approval action card configured.](media/234ccb521d34e82772e75c627ee0deab.png)

### Assign security roles

Once the importation completes, assign security roles to members of the organization. The main solution comes with three security roles.

Review roles and assign roles based on responsibility.

- **Automation Project Admin** - Maintains the configuration data in the Automation CoE and maps automation projects to environments.
- **Automation Project Contributor** - Generates or requests new automation projects.
- **Automation Project Viewer** - The business process owner who approves or rejects automation project requests.

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
1. Select your main environment.
1. Select **See all** under **Security roles** on the **Access** card.
   ![A screenshot that displays the see all link for security roles](media/3a5f46ffdae69744e5f820965b184d99.png).
1. Select the security role, and then add members to the security role.

### Sync environments

1. The main solution has a cloud flow called **Sync Environments**. Select this flow, and then trigger it if it hasnâ€™t run.

1. Wait for the run to complete.

### Import the desktop flow actions csv

Next, we want to import all the desktop flow actions from the csv file into the **Desktop Flow Action** table.

This must be done for all environments to which the Automation CoE syncs, such as main and all satellites.

1. Open a browser, navigate to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com), and then sign in.
1. Navigate to your environment where the solution is installed.
1. Select the **Solutions** tab.
1. Find, and then select the **Automation CoE Main** solution**.
1. Select the **Desktop Flow Action** table.
1. Select the **Data** tab.
1. Select the **Data dropdown** near the top.
1. Under **Get data**, select **Get data from Excel**.

   ![A screenshot that shows the steps to select the option to get data from Excel](media/eca274b494bf842915ab6325ef61aa73.png)

1. After the popup opens, select the **Upload** button, and then upload the included Excel file (autocoe_desktopflowactions.csv).

   ![A screenshot that displays the upload button](media/de9f4d99e8237715d0c4f0e10b999905.png)

1. Wait for the **Mapping status** to show as successful.
1. Select **Import**.

   ![A screenshot that displays the mapping was successful and the import button](media/9b6a9bdb7c1ee0a5239c800f19f1048c.png)

1. After the import completes, verify that the data was imported.

   ![A screenshot that displays the importation was successful and data imported](media/d4386a5213a442f04f533c4dbd843273.png)

### Verify the Desktop Flow Actions

1. Under **Tables**, select the **Desktop Flow Action** table.
2. Verify there is data under the **Data** tab.

   ![A screenshot that displays the data is available.](media/e45e4cfc0dc1d875e8a6140b81a0f825.png)

## Setup satellites

### Create an Azure AD app registration to connect to Dataverse Web API

Use the following steps to create an app registration that will be used by flows in the satellite environment.

1. Sign in to [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.
1. Select **New Registration**.
1. Enter a name (for example, Automation CoE Dataverse API), leave everything else, and the select **Register**.
1. In the **Overview tab**, select **Add an Application Id URI**.

   ![A screenshot that displays the application id](media/f589cd35a86eb9debd295ef1e66b998d.png)

1. Select **Set**, leave the default, and then select **Save**.

    ![A screenshot that displays set application id](media/e21d24f573f5401c4a9ea30f5e8a5954.png)

### Add a new client secret

1. Select **Certificates & secrets.**
1. Select **New client secret.**

   ![A screenshot that displays the steps to the new client secret button.](media/a6f25357bcaa11f0c49c91bb4f517ee7.png)

1. Enter description (for example, Auto CoE Dataverse), and then select appropriate expiry value.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy down the secret value that's generated.

   This secret will be added to **Azure Key Vault** in a later step.

1. Go back to the **Overview** tab and then copy down the following information.

    - Application (client) ID
    - Directory (tenant) ID

   ![A screenshot that displays the application and directory Ids](media/af0d7a6b6d83a55079039ddfd56ce531.png)

1. Next go to your Azure Key Vault, this is where we will store the values so that Power Automate can use them to call the Dataverse Web API.

### Create secrets for the client Id and tenant Id you copied earlier

1. Inside the **Secrets** tab, select **Generate/Import**.

   ![A screenshot that displays the Generate/Import button](media/48fe3244411a9db2a8385fab1c4e0520.png)

1. Use a descriptive name for each secret. Here are a few examples.

    - KVS-AutomationCoE-ClientID
    - KVS-AutomationCoE-TenantID
    - KVS-AutomationCoE-Secret

### Create a new environment or use an existing environment for your satellite

Microsoft recommends that you have the satellite solution imported inside your production environment. Follow the [steps to import the main solution](#import-the-main-solution-into-the-main-environment) if you create a new environment.

#### Create application user inside Dataverse (Per satellite Env)

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
1. Select the satellite environment, and then select **Settings**.
1. Select Users + permissions > Application Users > New app user.
1. Select **Add an app**.

1. Select the app registration that was created in previous steps.
    >[!TIP]
    >Verify by AppID if you're unsure.

1. Select a business unit.
1. Add the **System Administrator** security role.
1. Select **Create**.

   Your application user displays after it's created.

   ![A screenshot that displays the](media/ee7ca5d1c4aa6ebc302fc2439e750652.png)

### Import the satellite solution into the satellite environment

1. Sign into [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
1. Select your designated environment for the satellite solution.

   For this example, we're importing to the environment named **Contoso_Prod.**

1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.
1. Select **Import**, and then **Browse**.
1. Select the Automation CoE satellite solution (**AutomationCoESatellite_x_x_x_x_managed.zip**).
1. When the compressed (.zip) file loads, select **Next**.
1. Review the information, and then select **Next**.
1. Establish connections to activate your solution. If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.

### Configure environment variables

1. To get the information for the environment variables, open a new tab.
2. Navigate to the satellite environment from the [maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com).
3. Select the **Settings** in the top right nav bar > **Session details Developer resources**.

   ![A screenshot that displays the session details developer resources link](media/a22ea6e5f864bfbcfde3f76d82d4905d.png)

Next, we need to get the **URL path** for our **Azure Key Vault secrets**.

The Azure Key Vault secrets are using the new environment variable type. These environment variables need to be in the following format.
  
   ```azurecli
   /subscriptions/{Subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{Resource Group Name}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/{Key Vault Name}/secrets/{Secret Name}
   ```

Follow these steps to get the format.

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home), navigate to your Key Vault with the secrets for your [App Registration](#create-an-azure-ad-app-registration-to-connect-to-dataverse-web-api).
1. Select the **Secrets** tab.
1. Copy the **URL**.

    ![A screenshot that displays the the secrets URL](media/7ff5dd01f7ae3ef988b5d70c817d531a.png)

1. Paste the URL into notepad.
1. Remove everything from **https://** to **/resource**.

   ![A screenshot that displays the the parts of the URL to remove](media/de7d37307607c10210a3d198898d1f40.png)

1. At the end of the URL, add **/{SecretName}**. Replace **{secretname}** with your **secret name**.

   ![A screenshot that displays where to add the secret name to the URL](media/f3a766841010d270450aaa0ec4c2ecf7.png)

1. Do this for all three Azure Key Vault secrets (Client ID, Client Secret, Tenant ID).
    See the example in the screenshot. These reference strings are needed for three environment variables.

   ![A screenshot that displays the environment variables](media/247d5b62089b726962d20f94ae46e062.png)

Use this information for the environment variables.

#### ROI Calculations

Example data:

| **Cost Element**       | **Input** |
|------------------------|-----------|
| FTE Cost               | \$50/hr   |
| Time to Process (mins) | 60 mins   |
| Frequency              | Daily\*   |
| \# of FTEs to Process  | 1         |
| Error Rate (%)         | 10%       |
| \# of FTEs to Fix      | 1         |
| Time to Fix (mins)     | 25        |
| Overhead               | 15%       |

**\*Hourly = 2008, Daily = 251, Weekly = 52, Monthly = 12, Quarterly = 4**

#### ROI Calculation Formula

**Total Cost per Year** = Cost to Complete (per Year) + Cost to Remediate (per Year)

**Cost to Complete (per Year):**

((((FTE Cost/60) x \# of FTEs to Process) x Time to Process (mins)) x Frequency)

**Cost to Remediate (per Year):**

(((Frequency x (Error Rate/100)) x Time to Fix (mins)) x FTE Cost/60) x \# of FTEs to Fix))

**Full Formula:**

((((FTE Cost/60) x \# of FTEs to Process) x Time to Process (mins)) x Frequency) + (((Frequency x (Error Rate/100)) x Time to Fix (mins)) x FTE Cost/60) x \# of FTEs to Fix))

#### ROI Calculation Example

|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cost to Complete (per Year)      | \$12,550 (((FTE Cost/60) x \# of FTEs to Process) x Time to Process) x Frequency                     |
| Cost to Remediate (per Year)     | \$522.92 ((Frequency x (Error Rate/100)) x Time to Fix (mins)) x ((FTE Cost/60) x \# of FTEs to Fix) |
| Cost to Remediate (per Instance) | \$20.83 (Cost to Remediate (per Year) / (Frequency x (Error Rate/100))                               |
| Total Cost per Year              | \$13,072.92 (Cost to Complete (per Year) + Cost to Remediate (per Year)                              |
| Total Cost per Month             | \$1,089.41 (Cost to Complete per Year / 12)                                                          |
| Cost per Instance                | \$52.08 (Cost to Complete per Year / Frequency)                                                      |
