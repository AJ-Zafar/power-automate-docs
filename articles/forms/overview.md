# Overview of flows with Microsoft Forms 

Connectors serve as a way to connect to a service from Microsoft Power Platform. There are numerous types of form connectors available, including the [Microsoft Forms](/connectors/microsoftforms/) connector. Microsoft Forms is a new part of Office 365 Education that allows teachers and students to quickly and easily create custom quizzes, surveys, questionnaires, registrations, and more. You can follow these instructions to create a Microsoft Form.

## Microsoft Forms trigger
A trigger is the event that starts the flow. For example, Here is the full list of the Microsoft Forms triggers.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Forms trigger screen](..\media\forms\forms-trigger.png "Screen showing the forms trigger in Power Automate")

## Microsoft Forms action
Actions are the events you want the workflow to do once the trigger takes place. Here is the full list of the Forms actions. The trigger doesnâ€™t contain dynamic content that includes all of the responses, so you always need to use When a new response is identified with Get response details.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Forms action screen](..\media\forms\forms-action.png "Screen showing the forms action in Power Automate")
