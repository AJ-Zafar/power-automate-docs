# Guided Learning for PowerApps

Welcome to **Guided Learning** for Microsoft Flow. This self-paced online course explains Microsoft Flow in a sequential way, so you can build your knowledge from the ground up.

This  **Guided Learning**  course currently has a Getting Started section, and we will add content over the next few weeks. The course is designed to provide guidance in understandable chunks, with a logical flow that helps you learn concepts, details, and examples. It includes lots of visuals to help you learn, too. 

If you're a **beginner** with Microsoft Flow, this course will get you going, and if you're a Microsoft Flow **veteran** this course will tie concepts together, and fill in the gaps. We hope you enjoy the course, and look forward to including more content in the future.


## What is Microsoft Flow?

Microsoft Flow is a service that allows you to create automated workflows between your favorite web applications and services to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more.  For example, you could log your favorite Twitter user's tweets to an Excel file, or get an email notification every time a new item is posted to a Sharepoint list.  Microsoft Flow isn't limited to applications on the internet.  You can include on-premise data in your flows, too, like from SharePoint and SQL Server.

## What you can do with Microsoft Flow

The [list of connected apps](https://flow.microsoft.com/services/) (we call them **connectors**) is constantly expanding.  Some examples of tasks you can automate with Microsoft Flow are:

- Instantaneously respond to critical notifications or emails.
- Inform the whole team whenever a work item is updated.
- Capture, track, and follow-up with new sales leads.
- Get an overview of the data your flows are automatically collecting.

For more ideas, see our [list of pre-made templates](https://flow.microsoft.com/templates/).  Got a great idea for a flow you don't see in that list?  No problem!  You can create your own from scratch and, if you want, share it with the community!

## Creating and administering flows

To create and administer flows, you can use the web app, or you can use the mobile app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-flow/id1094928825) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.flow), Windows coming soon).  Whichever platform you choose, itâ€™s easy to diagnose issues, synchronize data, and more:

- Turn flows on or off from wherever you are.
- See when a flow has failed.
- Review detailed run history reports.
- View and filter runs by notification type. 

## Next Steps

Now that you've gotten a taste of what Microsoft Flow is and what it can do, let's take a look at what makes a flow.
