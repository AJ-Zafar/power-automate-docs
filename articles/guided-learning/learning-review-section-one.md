# Review the first section

Let's do a quick review of what you learned in the first section.

**Microsoft Flow** is a service to create automated workflows between your favorite **web applications and services**.  You can also connect to **on-premise data sources**.

**Flow** provides many **pre-built templates** to get up and running quickly, or you **create your own flows from scratch**.   

There are several building blocks to **Microsoft Flow**, including **connectors**, **triggers**, **actions**, and **conditions**.  In combination with more advanced components, like **loops**, you can create robust, intelligent automation that connects your various data sources and destinations.

The easiest way to get started with Flow is to use the templates, and play around with some blank flows. 


## What's next?
Congratulations! You have finished the first section of Microsoft Flow Guided Learning. Regardless of how much experience you began with, we hope you now have a very clear picture of what Microsoft Flow is and how you can start creating flows. We will add more sections in the near future, so please stay tuned.

In the meantime, here are some resources you should find useful on your journey.
