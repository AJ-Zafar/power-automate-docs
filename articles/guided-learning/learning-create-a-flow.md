# Guided Learning for Microsoft Flow

Welcome back to **Guided Learning** for Microsoft Flow. In this session, we will start to show you some more of the Microsoft Flow environment, and introduce you to building your first flow.

Getting started with **Microsoft Flow** is easy, as we have a HUGE number of templates for you to choose from which will help you connect the services you are already using in more meaningful ways.  

## Flow Website for Templates
Let’s jump onto the flow website and take a look.
![Flow Website -> Templates](./media/learning-create-a-flow/templates.png)
 
**Open** the **Templates** menu.

As you scroll through the list, you see that **Microsoft Flow** allows you to connect to many services.

## Working with Templates

To highlight that, let’s go ahead and start with one of these templates that I think is useful.

![Office 365 email](./media/learning-create-a-flow/office-365-email.png)

We are going to use this **template** that will put all of your email attachments into a folder in your OneDrive. I don’t know about you guys, but **searching for attachments** through email is a nightmare for me and this flow saves me time as I have one central location for all my incoming documents.

Click the **Save Office 365 email attachments to OneDrive for business** template.


## Create and Administer a Flow

This is one of our new – **one click** templates, where we try and only ask relevant questions necessary to **build** the flow without having you deal with the editor screens, which you haven’t seen yet.
Here, you can see a **detailed description** of what the template does and needs.

![Save Office 365 email](./media/learning-create-a-flow/save-flow-office-description.png)

You are asked to **provide credentials** for the Office 365 Outlook and SharePoint services. 
If you use both services regularly, you will already be **signed into** them. 

![Click create flow](./media/learning-create-a-flow/click-create-flow.png)

Click **Create Flow**, and Voila! 

![Create successful](./media/learning-create-a-flow/create-successful.png)

Flow has created a **folder** in my OneDrive where it will now automatically place every **attachment** that gets emailed to my work email.

![Click my flows](./media/learning-create-a-flow/click-my-flows.png)

**Click My Flows**, and

![Click the flow](./media/learning-create-a-flow/click-the-flow.png)

**click** the **flow** we just made to see how it works.

![Flow successful](./media/learning-create-a-flow/flow-successful.png)

You see a message that the flow succeeded. 

![Run history](./media/learning-create-a-flow/run-history.png)

**Click Succeeded** to see the run history and the results are that **all parts** of the flow were successful.


## Important Concepts in Microsoft Flow

Some things to know about when building flows. 
Every flow has two key parts, a **trigger** and one or more **actions**. 
 
You can think of the **trigger** as the starting action for the flow, which can be things like **On new Email** that we have here or, when a **new item** is added, if you happened to be using SharePoint. It can also be a fixed schedule, if we use a trigger called **Recurrence** which we will discuss  later.

![Actions on new email](./media/learning-create-a-flow/trigger-or-action.png)

**Actions** are the activities you want to happen when a **trigger** is invoked. For example, **Create file** like we have here, to recreate the file in OneDrive. 

Other actions could be,  **send** an email, **post** a Tweet, start an **Approval** or many, many others.
These will all come into play later, as we build our own Flows from scratch. 


## Next Lesson

In our next lesson, we will look at the Microsoft Flow mobile app and its capabilities.
