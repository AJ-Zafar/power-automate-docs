# Use the Microsoft Common Data Model in a flow #
The [Microsoft Common Data Model](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/data-platform-intro/) is a secure business database that comprises well-formed standard business entities that you can deploy for use in your organization. With the Common Data Model, you can improve operational efficiency with a unified view of business data. The Common Data Model provides standard entities common across most industry domains â€“ Sales, Purchase, Customer Service, and Productivity among others. You can also store organizational data in one or more [custom entities](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/data-platform-create-entity/), which offer several benefits over external data sources such as Microsoft Excel and Salesforce.

Microsoft Flow and the Common Data Model work well together in two key ways:

- If you already use the Common Data Model to [build an app in PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/data-platform-create-app/), you can use flows to import data, export data, or take action on top of data (such as sending a notification). Note that this approach isn't a full synchronization service; it simply allows you to move data in or out on a per-entity basis.

	For detailed steps, see the procedures later in this topic.

- As an alternative to [creating an approval loop through email](wait-for-approvals.md), you can now create a custom app in which users can approve or reject items. To store the approval state, you build a flow that updates an entity in the Common Data Model when the approval loop starts and ends.

	For detailed steps, see [Build an approval loop with the Common Data Model](common-data-model-approve.md).

## Open a template ##
1. If you haven't already, sign up for [Microsoft Flow](sign-up-sign-in.md) and [PowerApps](signup-for-powerapps.md).

1. If you're new to the Common Data Model, [open the Entities tab](https://web.powerapps.com/#/entities) of powerapps.com, and then click or tap **Create my database**.

1. Open the [Microsoft Flow portal](https://flow.microsoft.com), and then click or tap **Sign in** in the upper-right corner.

	**Note**: you might need to maximize your browser window to show the **Sign in** button.

	![Sign in](./media/common-data-model-intro/signin-flow.png)

1. In the **Search templates** box at the top of the screen, type or paste **common** and then press Return.

	![Search for templates](./media/common-data-model-intro/template-search.png)

1. In the list of templates, click or tap the template that imports data from the source you want into the entity (or *object*) that you want.

	For example, click or tap the template that imports contact information from Dynamics CRM into the Common Data Model.

	![Choose a template](./media/common-data-model-intro/choose-template.png)

1. Click or tap **Use this template**.

	![Use template](./media/common-data-model-intro/use-template.png)

1. If you haven't already created a connection from Microsoft Flow to Dynamics CRM, click or tap **Sign in**, and then provide your credentials.

	![Sign in to Dynamics CRM](./media/common-data-model-intro/dynamics-signin.png)

1. Click or tap **Continue**.

	![Confirm accounts](./media/common-data-model-intro/confirm-accounts.png)

## Build your flow ##

1. In the first card, specify the event that will trigger the flow.

	For example, you're building a flow that will copy new contacts from an instance of Dynamics CRM to the Common Data Model. Under **When a record is created**, specify the instance by clicking or tapping the down arrow and then clicking or tapping an option in the list that appears.

	![Specify instance of Dynamics CRM](./media/common-data-model-intro/specify-instance.png)

1. Under **Create object**, click or tap the down arrow, and then click or tap the database into which you want to import data.

	![Specify database](./media/common-data-model-intro/specify-database.png)

1. (optional) Near the top of the screen, specify a different name for the flow that you're creating.

	**Note**: If your browser window isn't maximized, the UI might look slightly different.

	![Name flow](./media/common-data-model-intro/name-flow.png)

1. Click or tap **Create flow**.

	**Note**: If your browser window isn't maximized, only the checkmark may appear.

	![Create flow](./media/common-data-model-intro/create-flow.png)

Now, whenever that object is created in the source system, it will be imported into the Common Data Model. If you can't find a template that does what you need, you can [build a flow from scratch](get-started-logic-flow.md) that operates on top of the Common Data Model.

You can take actions on changes in the Common Data Model. For example, you can send notification mail whenever data changes.
