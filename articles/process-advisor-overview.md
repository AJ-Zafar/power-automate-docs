# Overview of process advisor (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## What is process advisor?

To help you better understand places to streamline workflows, process advisor:

- Identifies which activities take the most time.
- Provides insights about which parts of your processes would be best to automate.
- Reveals ways to improve efficiencies.

Process advisor quickly captures detailed steps for each process in your organization&mdash;working on your own or inviting colleagues to contribute and collaborate. Process advisor uses *process mining* to help you:

- Understand where the bottlenecks are.
- Discover which steps are repeated the most.
- Find opportunities to automate with end-to-end visualizations of each process you record.

## Business example

For example, in a healthcare facility, you can use process advisor to record patient check-in procedures. Process advisor automatically produces a process map that visualizes the check-in process. You can see which activities take the longest, how many variations of the check-in process there are, and what variations and actions take the most time.

Application analytics and analytics dashboards show you which applications teams spend the most time in, and the best activities to optimize. You are then guided to create cloud flows with automation recommendations that reveal which connectors to use based on your workflows.

With insights and guided recommendations from process advisor, you are ready to begin automating, and reclaim the time you need for what matters most.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using process advisor, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Microsoft Power Platform environment with Microsoft Dataverse database.
  - For information about how to create environment, see [Create and manage environments in the Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/create-environment).
  - For information about how to add database to environment, see [Add a Microsoft Dataverse database](/power-platform/admin/create-database).
- A [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/) license.
