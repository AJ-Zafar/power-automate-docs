# Power Automate regions overview

In Power Automate, your flows are created within your Power Platform environment. These environments are specific to a region, which corresponds to the location of the datacenters where your Power Platform environment is stored.

In other words, your flows are deployed in the [datacenter region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) that hosts your [Power Platform environment](environments-overview-admin.md).

## Region mappings for Power Automate and gateways

The region where the gateway is installed must map to your Power Automate region. Cross geographic boundaries aren't supported. 

Here's the mapping information:

## Frequently asked questions

### What region should I use?

It's a good idea to create your flow in an environment that's in the region closest to your customers. When the datacenters that host your environment are closer to the people accessing the information, you're likely to see better performance.

### How can I find out the region where my flow is deployed?

Administrators can identify the region by signing in to the Power Platform [admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). The **Environments** tab lists all existing environments and their regions.

### Is Power Automate available in national clouds?

Yes. [Learn more](./us-govt.md).

### What outbound IP addresses are used in each region?

See [Limits and configuration](limits-and-config.md).
