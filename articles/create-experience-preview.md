# Simplified experience to create a flow and use templates (preview)

*Add preview INCLUDE*

We're making it easier to create cloud flows and use templates. This simplified experience allows makers to quickly and easily create cloud flow automations to solve their business needs.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This experience might not be available in your region yet.

The new changes will allow you to:

- Start creating a flow directly on the Power Automate home page.

- Receive guided instruction for building your flow.

- Find a template that addresses your needs by filtering through selections.

- Automate your flows with new options in the **New flow** dropdown menu.

## Create a flow

You can start creating a flow as soon as you sign in to Power Automate (link) by selecting **Create** at the top of the screen.

You can then choose your path for creating a flow. Your two choices are to start with a template, or build your own flow.

## Choose a template

Power Automate makes intelligent choices to find the templates that align best with your needs. It does this by filtering out the templates that won't work for you, leaving you with only the templates that are relevant. You can set the filters to show as many selections as you want, or search for templates using keywords.

For example, if you select **Microsoft Dataverse** in the **Filter by** group, you'll get a list of 60 templates to choose from. If you're looking for Dataverse templates that include email, you can type **email** in the **Searrch by keywords** list. This will reduce the list to 19 templates.

We've removed the **Templates** option on the left and replaced it with this experience so that you don't need to go through hundreds of templates to find what you want.

## Build your flow

If you choose to build your own flow instead of starting with a template, Power Automate will guide you in selecting your triggers, actions, and connectors.
