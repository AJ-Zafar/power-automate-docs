# Create flows in Microsoft Teams

There are multiple ways in which you can create flows within Microsoft Teams.

- Power automate flow templates are directly integrated into the Microsoft Teams store. Users can browse and acquire flows directly from this new entrypoint in Teams.
- You can also create flows from the overflow menu of  Teams message. 
- You can also use the [Power Automate app](./install-teams-app.md) to create from a template or from scratch

Flows created from either of these entrypoints can be managed directly within the Power Automate portal or from within the [Power Automate app](./install-teams-app.md) in Teams

## Prerequisites

To use the Power Automate app, you need an account with access to [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com).

## Create a cloud flow from a template in the Power Automate App

>[!NOTE]
>By default, the Power Automate app shows you templates that have been created for Microsoft Teams. You can switch filters on the top right to view all Power Automate templates, if desired.
 
![Create tab filter.](../media/power-automate-teams-app-create/create-filter.png)

Follow these steps to create a cloud flow from a Microsoft Teams template:

1. Sign into [Microsoft Teams](Https://Teams.Microsoft.com).

   >[!TIP]
   >You may also use the Microsoft Teams app.

1. Select **Apps** on the right side on the screen.
1. Search for, and then select the **Power Automate** app.

   ![A screenshot that shows a search for the Power Automate app.](../media/power-automate-teams-app-create/search-app.png)

1. Select the **Create** tab, and then select the template on which you'd like to base your flow.

   ![Create tab.](../media/power-automate-teams-app-create/create-tab.png)

1. If the template that you selected is optimized for Microsoft Teams, a dialog that lets you rename the flow and authenticate with the apps necessary for the flow displays.
   ![Setup connections.](../media/power-automate-teams-app-create/template1.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >You must login to all connectors so that your flow can run successfully. A green check indicates that you've authenticated.

1. Set up the connections as needed.

1. Select **Continue** to get a list of parameters that are necessary for the flow to run successfully. Provide the parameters that are needed.
   
   ![Setup parameters.](../media/power-automate-teams-app-create/template2.png)

   If you wish to see the full flow, select **Edit in advanced mode**.
   
   ![Advanced mode.](../media/power-automate-teams-app-create/template-advanced.png)

1. You're all set! You will get a confirmation screen showing that your flow was successfully created. After you create your flow, you can find it on the **Home** tab.

   ![Confirmation screen.](../media/power-automate-teams-app-create/template3.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When you create flows from within the Power Automate app in Microsoft Teams, they are always created in your organization's default environment. You can also access these flows from [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).

## Create a cloud flow from scratch

If you want full control over the flow that you create, select **Create from blank** from the top right side of the screen, instead of using a template.

   ![Create from blank.](../media/power-automate-teams-app-create/create-blank.png)

This brings up the full Power Automate designer experience within Microsoft Teams where you can [create a fully customized flow](../get-started-logic-flow.md).

## Known issues

- Any flow that you create from within the Power Automate app is located in your organization's default environment.
- The Power Automate app and Power Automate Actions app need to be enabled in the Microsoft Teams admin center [https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) in order for this functionality to work.
