## Getting started with Microsoft cognitive actions

Microsoft cognitive services enable users to accelerate decision-making using artificial intelligence without requiring machine learning expertise. 

Power Automate for desktop provides a wide variety of Microsoft cognitive actions that allow you to integrate this functionality into your flows. Text analysis, computer vision, and spell checking are all tasks that Microsoft cognitive actions can perform.

All Microsoft cognitive actions require a subscription key that validates your subscription for a service or group of services. The keys are available in the Azure portal for each resource that you've created.
