Click to the left of the running order number in the workspace to place a breakpoint in the flow, which appears as a red dot. This will cause the flow to pause at the action marked by a breakpoint. Resume running the flow by selecting **Run** or **Run Step by Step**. Select the breakpoint to remove it.
