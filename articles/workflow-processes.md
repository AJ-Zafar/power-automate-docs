# Classic Common Data Service workflows 

Workflows automate business processes without a user interface. People usually use workflow processes to initiate automation that doesnâ€™t require any user interaction.

There are two types of workflows:
1. Realtime workflows. See the [Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro) documentation for more details about realtime workflows.
1. Background workflows. See other topics here in the Power Automate documentation to learn more about background workflows.
