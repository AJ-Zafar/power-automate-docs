# Manage desktop flows

After you've created desktop flows, you might need to view, edit, or just check on their status. To do this, go to the **Desktop flows** tab.

## List of desktop flows

1. Sign into Power Automate.
1. Select **My flows** > **desktop flows**.

   ![View all desktop flows](../media/manage-desktop-flows/view-all.png "View all desktop flows")

From this section, you can create a new UI flow and edit or delete your existing desktop flows.

## Details page

For each of your desktop flows, you can see its details by selecting its name from the list of desktop flows. You then see details including:

-   The run history with details of each run.
-   The applications or Websites used in the UI flow.

Follow these steps to see the details for a UI flow:

1. Sign into Power Automate.
1. Select **My flows** > **Desktop flows**.
1. Select any of your desktop flows.
