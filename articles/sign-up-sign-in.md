# Sign up and sign in for Microsoft Flow #

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cRkmSZrctLc?list=PL8nfc9haGeb55I9wL9QnWyHp3ctU2_ThF" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Before you can create a flow, sign up by using any email address. If you've never used an online Microsoft product with that address, you'll need to take a few moments to register it.

**Note**: Microsoft Flow used to block personal email addresses, such as those that end in **@outlook.com** or **@gmail.com**. This issue has been fixed so you can now sign in with any Microsoft Account, which is any account that you've registered with Microsoft.

## Sign up ##

If you haven't used other online Microsoft products then you will need to sign up.

1. In [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com), click or tap **Sign up free** in the upper-right corner.

1. Specify your email address, and then click or tap **Go**.

## Sign in ##

If you have used other Microsoft online products, either for work or yourself, then all you need to do is Sign in.

1. In [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com), click or tap **Sign in** in the upper-right corner.

1. Specify your email address.

1. On the sign-in page for your organization or for Microsoft Accounts, specify your address and password.

## Troubleshooting ##
In many cases, you can register for Microsoft Flow by following the simple process described earlier in this topic. However, this table summarizes the most common reasons why you may not be able to sign up and describes available workarounds.

| Symptom / Error Message | Cause and Workaround |
|  --------------------------------- | -------------------------------|
| **.gov or .mil email addresses**<br>You receive a message like the following during signup:<br><br>*Microsoft Flow unavailable: Microsoft Flow is not available for users with .gov or .mil email addresses at this time. Use another work email address or check back later.* | You cannot currently sign up for Microsoft Flow with a .gov or .mil address. Instead, you can sign in with any Microsoft Account email address such as a *@outlook.com* address. |
| **Self-service signup disabled**<br><br>You receive a message like the following during signup:<br>*We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Flow. Contact them to complete signup.* <br>or<br> *We can't finish signing you up. It looks like Microsoft Microsoft Flow isn't currently available for your work or school.* | You have selected **Sign up** instead of of **Sign in**. If you select **Sign in** in the top of the home page you will be able to access Microsoft Flow. |
| **Email address is not an Office 365 ID**<br><br>You receive a message like the following during signup:<br>*We can't find you at contoso.com.  Do you use a different ID at work or school? Try signing in with that, and if it doesn't work, contact your IT department.* | Your organization uses IDs to sign in to Office 365 and other Microsoft services, and those IDs differ from your email address. For example, your email address might be Nancy.Smith@contoso.com, but your ID might be nancys@contoso.com. To complete signup, use the ID that your organization has assigned to you for signing in to Office 365 or other Microsoft services. |

## Next steps ##
- [Start with a template](get-started-logic-template.md), which is a pre-built flow that's set up for you.
- [Start from blank](get-started-logic-flow.md) if you already have a process in mind and can't find a template for it.
