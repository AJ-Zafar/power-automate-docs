# Send and receive push notifications

The notifications feature allows you to send and receive push notifications. To get to the **Notifications** screen, tap the bell icon in the app header.

When you tap the bell icon, you'll see a list of all notifications and flow alerts. If you've used the previous Power Automate mobile app version, you know this as Activity Feed.

Notifications that are new since the last time you opened the app are in the **New** list. Notifications that have existed prior to opening the app are in the **Older** list. Notifications will be removed after 14 days.

## Filter your notifications

You can narrow down the list of notifications to show only those related to a flow, or only those with a run status error.

To view notifications that are the result of a flow run, select **From flows**. Here's an example:

To view notifications with a run status error, select **Run status**. Here's an example:

Notifications are bound to the environment currently selected. You can change environments to see its associated notifications. To learn more, go to [Change environments](overview-mobile.md#change-environments).
