# Customizing Approvals in Teams

By default the approvals app only lets you modify custom responses in the app. 

If you want to create a custom process with pre and post approval actions that are utomatically triggered using an event, you will need to create an approval flow in the Power automate portal.

[Visit our Approvals documentation section to get started with Approval flows](../get-started-approvals.md)
