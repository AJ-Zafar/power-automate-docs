# Test a flow with Microsoft Flow #
Before you finish creating a flow, test it to verify whether it runs as you expect.

1. Create or modify a flow, and then select **Test flow**.

 	For example, [create a flow](get-started-logic-template.md) that sends email to an address that you specify whenever anyone tweets using a particular keyword or hashtag, such as **#azure**. The email contains details about the tweet.

	[Show an authored flow with emphasis on the **Test flow** button]

1. Perform the trigger action.

 	For example, send a tweet that contains the #azure hashtag.

	[Show the prompt of "This flow can't be tested until the trigger action is performed"]

	Your flow runs, and the results appear in the designer.

	[Show successful result.]

1. (optional) Select an individual trigger or action to show the inputs and outputs of the execution.

	[Show a trigger that's expanded to show inputs and outputs]

1. Select **Create** to finish creating the flow, or select **Edit** to make more changes.

	[Show flow with emphasis on the **Edit flow** and **Create** buttons]
