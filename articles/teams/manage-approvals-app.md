# Manage your approvals from the Approvals app in Teams

The Approvals app in Teams gives you an overview of all the approvals that you have sent or received in your organizations default tenant. This include approvals you might have received through chat or channel messages, direct approvals and even approvals that come in through a flow.

From here you can either approve/reject an approval you have received or cancel an approval you have already sent out.

## View Approvals

From the main approvals app in Teams you can get a view of all the approvals you have sent or received.

## Cancel an approval request

From the send approvals section you can also choose to cancel an approval that is still in progress. To do so simply click on the approval you want to cancel and click the Cancel approval option in the resultant dialog.

Note you can only cancel approvals that are in progress, i.e. ones where all the approvers have not yet responded.
