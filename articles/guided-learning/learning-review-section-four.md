# Review the fourth section

Let's review what we've learned in this section.

**Microsoft Flow** has several features for **enterprise users**: 

* An **environment** is a virtual space used to store, manage and share apps, flows and business data within the common data service.  Environments are geolocated so all apps and data stored within an environment's database are geolocated as well.
* With Microsoft Flow, you can easily create **data loss prevention** (DLP) policies to tightly control which consumer services your business data can be shared with when your users create flows.

## What's next?
