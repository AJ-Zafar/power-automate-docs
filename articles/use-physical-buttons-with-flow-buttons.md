## Start button flows with physical buttons

It's easy to trigger Microsoft Flow buttons from the Microsoft Flow mobile app on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.flow) and [iOS](https://appsto.re/us/5M0qbb.i), or from [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com). Now, you can also trigger your flows by touching a physical button. That's right, you can call your helpdesk, send an email to your team, block your calendar, reorder supplies, or even order a pizza, by pressing a physical button that executes a flow. Any button flow can be launched using a physical button from one of the two leading physical button manufacturers. Currently, Microsoft Flow partners with [bttn](https://my.bt.tn/) and [Flic](https://flic.io/), two of the leading physical button manufacturers. Visit their websites to learn more about their products, and then integrate your phsical buttons with your button flows.

## Prerequisites

To use physical buttons with Microsoft Flow, you must have:

- Access to [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com).

- Access to [bttn](https://my.bt.tn/) or [Flic](https://flic.io/)

- Registered one or more physical buttons on [bttn](https://my.bt.tn/) or [Flic](https://flic.io/).

Note: You must register your physical buttons and follow the instructions provided by the physical button's manufacturer before you can create flows that use the connectors from bttn and flic.


<!ADI: mainly shows the relevant connectors and refers to the partner website (bttn) and app (Flic).->


## Available Connectors
