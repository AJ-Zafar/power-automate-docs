# Getting started with Power Automate in Windows 11

Windows 11 comes with the Power Automate desktop app, a low-code application that enables home and business users to optimize their workflows and automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks.

Any Windows user can build flows without the need for coding experience. A collection of more than 400 pre-made actions and a recorder that captures mouse and keyboard functions make RPA intuitive for both regular and power users.

The Power Automate desktop app can automate tasks on Windows and any Microsoft or third-party application. Users can build flows that handle virtually any desktop task, such as populating forms, extracting data from desktop and web applications, interacting with Excel worksheets, handling files, and sending emails.

A typical scenario that many users confront is the creation of large-scale reporting. With Power Automate, they can automate the consolidation of data across multiple sources - such as databases, webpages, Excel files, and PDF files - and autogenerate reports. 

Apart from the pre-made actions and the recorder, the Power Automate desktop app provides an extensive exception handling functionality to ensure that the flows are robust and reliable in every scenario.

Business users also have access to centralized logs that include detailed information for every flow run and screenshots of errors. These logs make troubleshooting as easy as possible and enable businesses to effectively monitor the workflows on their machines.
