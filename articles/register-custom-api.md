# Register and use custom APIs in PowerApps
PowerApps enables you to build full-featured apps with no traditional application code. But in some cases you need to extend PowerApps capabilites, and web services are a natual fit for this. Your app can connect to a service, perform operations, and get data back. When you have a web service you want to connect to with PowerApps, you register the service as a custom API. This process enables PowerApps to understand the characteristics of your web API, including the authentication that it requires, the operations that it supports, and the parameters and outputs for each of those operations.

In this topic, we'll look at the steps required to register and use a custom API, and we'll use the Azure Cognitive Services [Text Analytics API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/text-analytics-api). This API identifies the language, sentiment, and key phrases in text that you pass to it. Below is a graphic that shows the interaction between the service, the custom API we create from it, and the app that calls the API.

{TODO: add graphic}

## Prerequisites

- A [PowerApps account](https://powerapps.microsoft.com).
- A Swagger file in JSON format, a URL to a Swagger definition, or a Postman Collection for your API. If you don't have any of these, we'll provide guidance for you.
- An image to use as an icon for your custom API (optional).


## Steps in the custom API process

The custom API process has several steps, which we describe briefly below. This article assumes you already have a RESTful API with some type of authenticated access, so we'll focus on steps 3-6 in the rest of the article. For an example of steps 1 and 2, see [Create a custom Web API for PowerApps](customapi-web-api-tutorial.md).

1. **Build a RESTful API** in the language and platform of your choice. For Microsoft technologies, we recommend one of the following.

	- Azure Functions
	- Azure Web Apps
	- Azure API Apps

2. **Secure your API** using one of the following authentication mechanisms. You can allow unauthenticated access to your APIs, but we don't recommend it.

	- Azure Active Directory
	- OAuth 2.0 for specific services like Dropbox, Facebook, and SalesForce
	- Generic OAuth 2.0
	- API Key
	- Basic Authentication

3. **Describe your API** in one of two industry-standard ways, so that PowerApps can connect to it.

	- A Swagger file
	- A Postman Collection

	You can also build a Swagger file in step 4 as part of the registration process.

4. **Register your API** using a wizard in PowerApps, where you specify an API description, security details, and other information.
5. **Use your API** in an app. Create a connection to the API in your app, and call any operations that the API provides, just like you call native functions in PowerApps.
6. **Share your API** like you do other data connections in PowerApps. This step is optional, but it often makes sense to share custom APIs across multiple app creators.


## Describe your API

Assuming you have an API with some type of authenticated access, you need a way to describe the API so that PowerApps can connect to it. To do this, you create a Swagger file or a Postman Collection â€“ which you can do from _any_ REST API endpoint, including:

- Publicly available APIs. Some examples include [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/), [Uber](https://developer.uber.com/), [Slack](https://api.slack.com/), [Rackspace](http://docs.rackspace.com/), and more.
- An API that you create and deploy to any cloud hosting provider, including Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Heroku, Google Cloud, and more.
- A custom line-of-business API deployed on your network as long as the API is exposed on the public internet.

Swagger files and Postman Collections use different formats, but both are language-agnostic machine-readable documents that describe your API's operations and parameters:
- You can generate these documents using a variety of tools depending on the language and platform that your API is built on. See the [Text Analytics API documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/export?DocumentFormat=Swagger&ApiName=Azure) for an example of a Swagger file.
- If you don't already have a Swagger file for your API and don't want to create one, you can still easily create a custom API by using a Postman Collection. See [Create a Postman Collection](postman-collection.md) for more information.
- PowerApps ultimately uses Swagger behind the scenes, so a Postman Collection is parsed and translated into a Swagger definition file. 

**Note**: Your file size must be less than 1MB.


### Getting started with Swagger and Postman

- If you're new to Swagger, see [Getting Started with Swagger](http://swagger.io/getting-started/) on the swagger.io site.
- If you're new to Postman, install the [Postman app](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) from their site.
- If your API is built with Azure API Apps or Azure Functions, see [Exporting an Azure hosted API to PowerApps and Microsoft Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-export-api-to-powerapps-and-flow) for more information.


## Register your API

You will now use the Swagger file or Postman Collection to register your custom API in PowerApps.

1. In [powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com), in the left menu, select **Connections**. Select the ellipsis (**...**), then select **Manage custom APIs** in the upper right corner.

	 **Tip**: If you can't find where to manage custom APIs in a mobile browser, it might be under a menu in the upper left corner.

	![Create custom API](./media/register-custom-api/managecustomapi.png)  

2. Select **Create custom API**.

	![Custom API properties](./media/register-custom-api/newcustomapi.png)

3. In the **General** tab, choose how you want to create the custom API.
	- Upload Swagger
	- Paste Swagger URL
	- Upload a Postman Collection V1

	![How to create custom API](./media/register-custom-api/choosehowtocreate.png)

	Upload an icon for your custom API. Description, Host, and Base URL fields are typically auto-populated with the information from the Swagger file. If they are not auto-populated, you can add information to those fields. Select **Continue**.

4. In the **Security** tab, enter any authentication properties. 

	![Authentication types](./media/register-custom-api/authenticationtypes.png)
	
	- The authentication type is auto-populated based on what is defined in your Swagger `securityDefinitions` object. Below is an OAuth2.0 example.
		
		```
		"securityDefinitions": {
			"AAD": {
			"type": "oauth2",
			"flow": "accessCode",
			"authorizationUrl": "https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/authorize",
			"scopes": {}
			}
		},
		```

	- If the Swagger file does not use the `securityDefintions` object, then no additional values are needed.
	- When using a Postman Collection, authentication type is auto-populated only when using supported authentication types, such as OAuth 2.0 or Basic.
	- For an example of setting up Azure Active Directory (AAD) authenthication, see the "Set up Azure Active Directory authentication" section of [Create a custom Web API for PowerApps](customapi-web-api-tutorial.md).

5. In the **Definitions** tab, all the operations defined in your Swagger file or Postman Collection, along with request and response values, are auto-populated. If all your required operations are defined, you can go to step 6 in the registration process without making changes on this screen.

	![Definition tab](./media/register-custom-api/definitiontab.png)

	If you want to edit existing actions or add new actions to your custom API, continue reading below.

	1. If you want to add a new action that was not already in your Swagger file or Postman Collection, select **New action** in the left pane and fill in the **General** section with the name, description, and visibility of your operation.

	2. In the **Request** section, select **Import from sample** on the top right. In the form on the right, paste in a sample request. Sample requests are usually available in the API documentation, where you can get information to fill out the **Verb**, **Request URL**, **Headers**, and **Body** fields. See the [Text Analytics API documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c6) for an example.

		![Import from sample](./media/register-custom-api/importfromsample.png)

	3. Select **Import** to complete the request definition. Define the response in a similar way.

6. Once you have all your operations defined, select **Create** to create your custom API.

7. Once you have created your custom API, go to the **Test** tab to test the operations defined in the API. Choose a connection, and provide input parameters to test an operation.

	![Test custom API](./media/register-custom-api/testcustomapi.png)

	If the call is successful, you get a valid response.

## Use your API

{TODO: Show connection to new API, then calling the API from an app to return the language of the text I pass.}

### Quota and throttling

- See the [PowerApps Pricing](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/) page for details about custom API creation quotas. Custom APIs that are shared with you don't count against this quota.
- For each connection created on a custom API, users can make up to 500 requests per minute.

## Share your API
Now that you have a custom API, you can share it with other users in your organization (but not publicly using PowerApps). Keep in mind that when you share an API, others might start to depend on it, and deleting a custom API deletes all the connections to the API.

1. In [powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com), in the left menu, select **Connections**. Select the ellipsis (**...**), then select **Manage custom APIs** in the upper right corner.

	![New connection](./media/register-custom-api/managecustomapi.png)

2. Select your API, select **Share**, and then enter the users or groups to whom you want to grant access to your API.  

	![Share custom API](./media/register-custom-api/sharecustomapi.png)

3. Select **Save**.
