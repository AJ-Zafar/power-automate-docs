# Manage approvals

The approvals feature allows you to manage your approval requests while you’re away from your desk. 

You can approve or reject a request directly from the **Approvals** screen.

## View approval details

As an alternative, you can view additional details such as comments and attachments of each approval in a separate screen.

To view approval details:

1. On the **Approvals** screen, select the vertical ellipses (**…**) next to a request.

1. Select **Details**.

    If you select **Approve**, you'll see this message on the **Approval details** screen:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/android/approve-select.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the approval submitted successfully message.":::

    If you select **Reject**, you'll see this message on the **Approval details** screen:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/android/reject-select.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the rejection submitted successfully message.":::

## Create custom responses

You can also create your own responses. For example, you might want to add a response called **Need more info** in addition to **Accept** and **Reject**. To learn how to create and use custom responses, go to [Create custom response options](../create-approval-response-options.md).
