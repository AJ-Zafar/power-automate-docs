# Common ways to use a form in a flow

If you're not sure where to start, these are some of the most common ways people use Microsoft Forms with Power Automate:

- [Send an email when there's a new form response](#send-an-email-when-theres-a-new-form-response)
- [Send an email to the form responder after they submit a response](#send-an-email-to-the-form-responder-after-they-submit-a-response)
- [Send an approval request with the form details](#send-an-approval-request-with-the-form-details)
- [Add form responses to an Excel worksheet](#add-form-responses-to-an-excel-worksheet)
- Get an attachment from a form and send an email with the attachment

## Send an email when there's a new form response

You can turn on email notifications in your form settings. If you want someone else to be notified when a response is submitted, create a custom email notification with Power Automate.

We'll start with a pre-built template and customize it to help our managers plan for employees' summer vacations.

1. Search for "Microsoft Forms" in the [Power Automate template gallery](https://flow.microsoft.com/templates/) and select the template named "Notify me in Outlook when a student completes a quiz."

1. Sign in to the connectors, if needed, and select **Continue**.

1. In the first step in the flow, "When a new response is submitted," select your form in the **Form Id** box.

1. In the next step in the flow, "Apply to each," select your form again in the **Form Id** box. Leave everything else as it is.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/email-flow-step2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Forms action in a flow under construction, with the form ID highlighted.":::

1. Skip the Microsoft Office "[Get my profile (V2)](/connectors/office365/)" step. (If you don't need to send the email to yourself, you may delete the step if you like.)

1. In the final step in the flow, "[Send an email](/connectors/office365/)," enter the recipients, subject, and body of the email. Select dynamic content to include details from the form response in your email.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/email-flow-step3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Outlook send email action in a flow under construction, with custom information highlighted.":::

1. Select the flow name at the top of the Power Automate canvas and change it as you like.

1. Save and test your flow.

## Send an email to the form responder after they submit a response

You can turn on [email receipts for respondents](https://support.microsoft.com/office/send-an-email-receipt-of-responses-951f29b7-dbd8-446b-8ebe-b924cc620bb20) in your form settings. If you want to customize the email they receive, use Power Automate.

Follow the steps to [send an email when there's a new form response](#send-an-email-when-theres-a-new-form-response), but send the email to the responder.

## Send an approval request with the form details

In this example, we'll start with another pre-built template and customize it to create a vacation approval request.

1. Search for "Microsoft Forms" in the [Power Automate template gallery](https://flow.microsoft.com/templates/) and select the template named "Send form responses for approval."

1. Sign in to or create the connectors, as needed, and select **Continue**.

1. In the first step in the flow, "When a new response is submitted," select your form in the **Form Id** box.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/email-flow-step1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Forms trigger in a flow under construction, with the form ID highlighted.":::

1. In the next step in the flow, "Apply to each," select your form again in the **Form Id** box. Leave everything else as it is.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/approval-flow-step2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Forms action in a flow under construction, with the form ID highlighted.":::

1. In the next step in the flow, "[Start and wait for an approval](/power-automate/modern-approvals#add-an-approval-action.md)," select the **Approval type**, enter a **Title**, and enter the approvers' email addresses in **Assigned to**. Select dynamic content to include details from the form response in the approval request.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/approval-flow-step3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an approval action in a flow under construction, with custom information highlighted.":::

1. Skip the "Condition" action.

1. In the "If yes" step:

    - Delete the SharePoint action that comes with the template.
    - Add an Outlook 365 "Send an email (V2)" action.
    - In the **To** box, select the dynamic content **Responders' Email**.
    - Enter the subject and body of the email.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/approval-flow-step-yes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a 'request approved' email in a flow under construction, with custom information highlighted.":::

1. In the "If no" step:

    - Delete the Microsoft Office "Get my profile (V2)" step that comes with the template.
    - In the "Send an email (V2)" action, in the **To** box, select the dynamic content **Responders' Email**.
    - Enter the subject and body of the email.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/approval-flow-step-no.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a 'request denied' email in a flow under construction, with custom information highlighted.":::

1. Select the flow name at the top of the Power Automate canvas and change it as you like.

1. Save and test your flow.

More examples of approval flows are in the [documentation](../sequential-modern-approvals.md).

## Add form responses to an Excel worksheet

In this example, we'll create a flow from blank. We'll use it to record employees' names and summer vacation dates in an Excel table.

1. Create a workbook in Excel Online. Add a table with one column for each question on your form. Save and close the workbook.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/excel-flow-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Excel table with three columns titled Name, Vacation Start, and Return.":::

1. In Power Automate, create an automated cloud flow from blank. Select the Microsoft Forms "When a new response is submitted" trigger.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/excel-flow-step1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a cloud flow with a Microsoft Forms trigger.":::

1. In the first step in the flow, "When a new response is submitted," select your form in the **Form Id** box.

1. Add a step to your flow:

    - Search for "forms" and select **Microsoft Forms**.
    - Select **Get response details**.
    - Select your form in the **Form Id** box.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/excel-flow-step2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Forms trigger and action in a flow under construction, with the form ID highlighted in each.":::

1. Add a step to your flow:

    - Search for "profile" and select **Office 365 Users**.
    - Select **Get user profile (V2)**.
    - In the **User (UPN)** box, select the dynamic content **Responders' Email**. This will look up the responder's name by their email address.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/excel-flow-step3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Office 365 Get user profile action in a flow under construction, with the dynamic content Responders' Email highlighted.":::

1. Add a step to your flow:

    - Search for "excel" and select **Excel Online (Business)**.
    - Select **Add a row into a table**.
    - Select the **Location** and **Document Library**.
    - Select the folder icon and browse to the Excel workbook you created earlier.
    - Select the **Table**.
    - In each column in the table, select the corresponding dynamic content.

:::image type="content" source="../media/forms/excel-flow-step4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Excel Add row into a table action in a flow under construction, with dynamic content highlighted.":::

1. Select the flow name at the top of the Power Automate canvas and change it as you like.

1. Save and test your flow.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/forms/excel-flow-table-after.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Excel table with Name, Vacation Start, and Return columns filled with form data.":::

You can also add an approval step before a form response is added to the Excel table. The [Approve a Microsoft Forms response to add a row to an Excel spreadsheet](https://flow.microsoft.com/galleries/public/templates/66f56b919fd64aeabec37245ed927c47/approve-a-microsoft-forms-response-to-add-a-row-to-an-excel-spreadsheet/) template can help you do this!

## Get an attachment from a form and send it in an email message

Ensure that youâ€™ve added a section in your form for the responder to upload their file.
 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Screenshot of forms upload section.](..\media\forms\forms-upload.png "Forms upload section")

After adding the Forms trigger and action, add the **Parse JSON** action. We recommend running the flow before adding this action to generate the JSON schema from a sample.
 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Screenshot of the Parse JSON action.](..\media\forms\flow-parse-json.png "Add the Parse JSON action")

Once youâ€™ve pasted the full sample, you can [Get file content using path](/connectors/onedrive/#get-file-content-using-path) from OneDrive and find your Microsoft Form. Then, add a â€˜/â€™ followed by the following expression: **first(body('Parse_JSON'))?['id']**. This would extract the one file that the responder will be uploading. 
 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Screenshot of Create share link.](..\media\forms\create-share-link.png "'Create share link' tile in Power Automate")

Finally, you can send that upload to via email using the [Send an email (V2)](/connectors/office365/#send-an-email-(v2)) action card from Office 365 Outlook. Include the expression **first(body('Parse_JSON'))?['id']**
