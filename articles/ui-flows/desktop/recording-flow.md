# Recording in a desktop flow

It's possible to design flows simply by performing the task you wish to automate, using the desktop recorder.

## Desktop Recorder
In the flow designer, select **Desktop recorder** in the toolbar to record desktop actions:

Select **Start recording** in the desktop recorder window to record actions.

The desktop recorder keeps track of mouse and keyboard activity in relation to UI elements, and records each action separately:

 Select **Pause recording** to suspend the recording of actions:

 Select **+** to add a comment to the Recorded actions:
