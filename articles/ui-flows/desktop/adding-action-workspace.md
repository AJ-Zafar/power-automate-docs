## Adding an action to the workspace

To begin developing a flow, start by selecting an action, and double clicking on it, or dragging and dropping it into the workspace. This opens a dialog with the parameters of the action. Actions have certain parameters such as variable names and default values. Other actions will require user input to be initialized. After selecting **Save**, the action appears in the workspace.
