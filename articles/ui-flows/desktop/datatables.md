# Data tables

A data table contains data in a tabular form. Data tables are the equivalent of two-dimensional arrays in programming terms. 

A data table contains rows and columns that describe the position of each item uniquely. Data tables can be considered as lists that contain other lists as items.

**Power Automate Desktop** doesn't provide a direct way to create a data table, but two actions generate a data table as output: the **Read from Excel** action and the **Execute SQL statement** action.

To retrieve a specific item of a data table, use the following notation: **%VariableName\[RowNumber\]\[ColumnNumber\]%**

For example, to access the A2 cell of a read Excel file, use the expression displayed below. Keep in mind that the **RowNumber** and the **ColumnNumber** should be 0 for the first item (row or column).

If you loop through a data table with a **For Each** action, the variable that will contain the current iterationâ€™s data is considered to be a data row.
