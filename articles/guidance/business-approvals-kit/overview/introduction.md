are approvals. Power Automate allows you to streamline your business by
digitalizing the approval experience.

allows your organization to configure sophisticated approvals such as

as expense reporting, work-time management, business travel requests,
procurement orders, sales discounts etc. With Microsoft Power Platform, you can
meet these approval needs by combining components from Microsoft Power Apps and
