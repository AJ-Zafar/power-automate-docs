# Get started with Microsoft Flow #
Welcome to Microsoft Flow! After you [sign up](sign-up-sign-in.md), you can quickly start to automate your work.

## Discover possibilities ##
If you [visit the home page](https://flow.microsoft.com) for Microsoft Flow, you can [explore a diverse set of templates](https://flow.microsoft.com/templates). Without even signing in, you can get a quick sense of what's possible and how Microsoft Flow could help your business and your life.

Each template is designed for a specific purpose such as texting you when your boss emails you, adding twitter leads to CRM, or backing up your files. These templates are just the tip of the iceberg and are intended to inspire you to create flows that are customized to the exact processes you need.

## Give yourself a head start ##

When you're ready, [sign in](https://flow.micosoft.com/signin) on your tablet, desktop, or even your phone. Now you can [use a template](get-started-logic-template.md) to get started.

You will need to also sign in to whatever services that type of template uses. Once you have signed in, you can click around the flow to see how it's configured and change any of the settings to make the flow your own, or even add or delete actions. Finally, after you select **Create** you can check to see if your flow is running as expected, or just click **Done**.

## Hit the ground running ##
Now that you have some idea of what a flow can do and a bit of experience, you can [create a flow from scratch](get-started-logic-flow.md). There are many different data sources, such as:

- an Excel file (stored locally or in a cloud-storage account such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive)
- a Google sheet
- a SharePoint list
- Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online with custom entities
- a SQL Azure table

With creating from scratch, the entire flow comes straight from your brain to the screen. With the training wheels off, you'll want to understand one or more of these concepts at a  deeper level:

- [Flows with many steps](multi-step-logic-flow.md)
- [Run tasks on a schedule](run-tasks-on-a-schedule.md)
- [Test your flows](testing-flows.md)
- [Create an approval flow](wait-for-approvals.md)
- [Publish a template](publish-a-template.md)
