# Microsoft Flow for ISVs and Microsoft partners

As a Microsoft partner or ISV, you can accelerate customer adoption by extending your products to integrate with your customers' data and business processes. Build connectors that enable your customers to connect to your products through Microsoft Flow. You can generate new leads for your business by building apps and publishing them to AppSource for new customers to test-drive.

## Build an API connector

Bring your product into the Microsoft cloud by building a connector that enables Microsoft Flow to talk to your service. [Learn more](api-connector-overview.md)

## Publish templates

Once you have a connector, you should publish templates that demonstrate how to use your service. These templates will serve as examples that users can use to learn and then extend to their own unique workflows. [Learn more](publish-a-template.md)

## Embed the flow experience in your website or app ##
Next, you can embed Microsoft Flow from within your app to enable deep, in-context integration between your app and all the other services that Microsoft Flow supports. For example, you can:

- Browse all of the templates that relate to your service and let users select a template
- Manage the flows that users have related to your app

Follow [this tutorial](embed-flow-dev.md) for more information about how to embed Microsoft Flow within an app.
