# New Power Automate experience (preview)

We've redesigned the Power Automate interface so that you can quickly and easily create cloud flows and use templates  to solve your business needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This preview experience is in the process of being rolled out, and might not be available in your region yet.
> - We'll soon update the Power Automate documentation to reflect the new experience.

The new changes will allow you to:

- Start creating a flow directly on the Power Automate home page.

- Receive guided instruction for building your flow.

- Find a template that addresses your needs by filtering through selections.

- Automate your flows with new options in the **New flow** dropdown menu.

## Create a flow

You can start creating a flow as soon as you sign in to Power Automate by selecting **Create** at the top of the screen.

You can then choose your path for creating a flow. Your two choices are to start with a template to find prebuilt flows, or build your own custom automation.

## Choose a template

Power Automate makes intelligent choices to find the prebuilt templates that align best with your needs. It does this by filtering out the templates that won't work for you, leaving you with only the templates that are relevant. You can set filters to show as many selections as you want, or search for templates using keywords.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-experience-preview/filter-by.png" alt-text="Screenshot of choosing filters and using keywords.":::

For example, if you select **Microsoft Dataverse** in the **Filter by** group, you'll get a list of 60 templates to choose from. If you're looking for Dataverse templates that include email, you can type **email** in the **Searrch by keywords** list. This will reduce the list to 19 templates.

## Build your flow

If you choose to build your own flow instead of starting with a template, Power Automate will guide you in selecting your triggers, actions, and connectors.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-experience-preview/connectors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the building your flow with triggers, actions, and connectors.":::

To learn more about creating a cloud flow, go to [Create a cloud flow in Power Automate](get-started-logic-flow.md). To learn more about triggers, go to [Get started with triggers](triggers-introduction.md). For an overview of connectors, go to [Connectors overview](/connectors/connectors).



## New flow menu options

If you're already working in the **My flows** screen, you can stay where you are and crete a new template from the **New flows** menu. The menu also gives you the option to start a desktop flow or a flow that uses AI Builder.
