# Getting started with a Microsoft account

Power Automate Desktop enables regular and power users alike to create flows which save time and eliminate human error. 

Focus on other activities by automating routine and repetitive tasks like organizing or backing up your files and folders. Create flows to extract product prices from a website and save them in an Excel spreadsheet and email it as an attachment. Fill in web forms by supplying information dynamically from your files.  

Create automated workflows with step-by-step guidance and an intuitive, no-code interface anyone can use, regardless of their technical expertise. Build flows from a wide variety of pre-made actions, or record your interactions as steps to be played back anytime.
