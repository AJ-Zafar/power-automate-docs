# Low-code RPA with SAP GUI in Power Automate Desktop

<!--todo: there are no 4 samples in the linked doc-->

With the addition of Power Automate Desktop, it's quicker and easier to develop low-code SAP GUI automations. Power Automate Desktop enables you to build from simple to highly sophisticated end-to-end automations. To showcase this, we'll perform the steps outlined in [4 Sample SAP scenario for testing](./sample-sap-scenario.md) using Power Automate Desktop actions. Weâ€™ll do some minor tweaks afterwards in the designer. To make our automation dynamic, we need to create some variables first, which we'll use to fill in data like street, city, country, and also system variables to connect to your SAP system.

Follow along in the [low-code approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9npROLFOqQ) in the video series.
