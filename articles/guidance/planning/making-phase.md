## Basic steps for Power Automate flows

The following are the basic steps for creating Power Automate flows.

1.  Specify an event / triggers to start the flow with
    [connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/). Based on what ways you
    want to trigger the automation, you will specify what event you want to use
    to trigger your Power Automate flow.

2.  [Add

    and [conditions](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/add-condition)
