# Use recurrence in Microsoft Flow 

In this lesson, you will see how to run Flows on a **Schedule** using a **trigger called Recurrence**.

## Prerequisites for this lesson ##

Before you get into the lesson, there are a couple of items that you'll need to create to build the flow: 
- An Excel workbook with customer data in a table. Include a **first name**, **last name**, and an **email address** in the file

![Create from blank](./media/learning-use-recurrence/1-blur-excel.png)

- A MailChimp account, and a **customer list in that account**. 

![Mailchimp lists](./media/learning-use-recurrence/2-mail-chimp-lists.png)

If you don't already have a MailChimp account, you can **sign up for an eFree trial** on their web site.

## Connect your services

As in the previous topic, if you are using a service that's new to you, then you may need to connect the new service in Microsoft Flow

Follow the instructions in the Guided Learning topic, Create Push Notifications in Microsoft Flow.

## A sample flow for you to build

Letâ€™s go ahead and build a flow for the Contoso marketing team. The flow **grabs customer emails from an excel table** on OneDrive for Business that the sales guy Dave uses when meeting new customers and **building quotes** for them.

The flow can be built so that daily, the email addresses that were **added to the spreadsheet** are then **added to a MailChimp customer list**. That list will then **receive** Contoso Flooring **marketing emails**.

 
## Build the flow from blank

Go ahead and get into Microsoft Flow, select **My flows**, and then select **+ Create from blank**. 

![Create from blank](./media/learning-use-recurrence/1-create-from-blank.png)

To schedule a recurrence, look for the **Schedule service** in the list. If you don't see it, **enter schedule** in the search box, and it pops right up.

And then use the **trigger recurrence**.

Select **Schedule**...

![Search connectors](./media/learning-use-recurrence/2-search-connectors.png)

and then select **Schedule - Recurrence**.

![Select schedule recurrence](./media/learning-use-recurrence/3-select-schedule-recurr.png)
What you want to do is **set the Interval** for 1 time and the **Frequency for each Day**.


![Set frequency](./media/learning-use-recurrence/4-set-frequency.png)


Go ahead and create another step to get the Excel rows that Dave the sales guy is adding in daily. 

**Note:** This is the Excel file that you created in the beginning of this lesson, for Dave the sales guy to fill with sales leads.

Select **+ New step** and then **Add an action**.

![Add step](./media/learning-use-recurrence/5-add-step.png) 
Enter **Excel in the search bar**, choose the service.


![Excel connect](./media/learning-use-recurrence/6-excel-connect.png)

Notice there is an **Excel - Get row**, where if selected, you would get only one row.

Choose **Excel - Get rows**, as you want to get all of the new  rows in the file.

![Get rows](./media/learning-use-recurrence/7-get-rows.png)

To show flow where your file lives,  select the folder on the **OneDrive for Business**. 

![Get onedrive file](./media/learning-use-recurrence/8-get-onedrive-file.png)

Select **Contoso-mailing-list** file from the list and select the Table 1 name.


![Mailing list](./media/learning-use-recurrence/9-mailing-list.png)

Now, you will decide what to do with that data in the Excel file. 

Select **+ New step** and then **Add an action**. 

![Add step](./media/learning-use-recurrence/10-add-step.png)

Enter **MailChimp** in the search bar.

Add the action **MailChimp - Add member to list** by selecting **PREMIUM**.

![Add member](./media/learning-use-recurrence/11-add-member-list.png) 

Select **Contoso Flooring Monthly Mailer**.

Enter **Status** as **subscribed**.

When you do this for real, you'll need permission from your contacts, to send them emails. You don't want your customers receiving emails they didn't sign up for.

Now, you need to tell MailChimp what information is going to be passed to it: an email address, first name, and last name.

Enter the **ContactEmail** from **dynamic content**.

Microsoft Flow did something interesting here. When you chose the **ContactEmail field**, it went ahead and put in an output parameter for you, which is, **apply to each**. Microsoft Flow was smart, and saw that **you were gonna set an action**, that needed an **additional action on top of it**. So now, what it will do as it grabs one of these is, it will **create a new action** for **each row it grabs**.

![Flow does smart](./media/learning-use-recurrence/12-flow-does-smart.png)

Enter dynamic content for **FirstName**, and **LastName**.

![List complete](./media/learning-use-recurrence/13-list-complete.png)

To finish, select **Save flow**.
![Save flow](./media/learning-use-recurrence/14-save-flow.png)

You see that your flow is updated and running.
