# Run a Power Automate Desktop flow

To run a flow from the console, either select a flow and select **Run** or right-click on the flow and select **Start**.

Flows running from the console will run from beginning to end without the Run delay. Running flows from the console will also ignore any breakpoints placed in the flow designer.
