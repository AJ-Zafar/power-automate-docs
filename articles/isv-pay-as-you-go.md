# Power Automate embed pay-as-you-go

<!--todo: Rakesh, in the opening sentence, you refer to 'Power Automate ISV Embed PayGo', however, am not able to find this term in our style guide, so I can't use it with the capitalization you used. Also, I notice you use 'Microsoft Cloud Embed program' later in this article. Did you mean to use 'Microsoft Cloud Embed program' in the opening sentence? -->
With Power Automate ISV embed pay-as-you-go, independent software vendors (ISVs) can integrate Power Automate into their solutions, and make it frictionless for their customers to use premium Power Automate capabilities in their own flows. With this program, ISVs pay for their customers’ consumption of Power Automate through the [pay-as-you-go meters](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/news/powerautomate_payg_pricing). Since ISVs pay for their customers' use of premium connectors, there's no need for these customers to purchase standalone Power Automate licenses to build and run flows with premium capabilities that the ISV offers.

You can learn more about the ISV Cloud Embed program here. <!--todo: deon to decide what to do with this sentence, based on response from PM about using the 'Microsoft Cloud Embed program'-->

With the connector-based approach, ISVs with premium connectors on Power Platform can make their connectors available to any Power Automate user. After the ISV starts their participation in this embed program, users without premium licenses can build premium flows with connectors that the ISV provides. This enables any user to leverage the premium capabilities of Power Automate and build flows to enhance the ISV’s products that they use.

As customers build and run flows with these premium connectors, Microsoft sends aggregate usage reports (flow runs involving this connector) at the tenant level with ISVs. No personal data or end user data will be shared as part of this program.

>[!NOTE]
>If a customer already has premium Power Automate licenses, the ISVs will not be billed for that consumption, and no aggregated usage reports are shared with ISVs.

After the ISV’s participation in the program ends, customers get advance notice to acquire a paid Power Automate license to keep their flows running.

<!-- Rakesh: I am happy to include a list of the partners who are in this program. Have you thought about how this list will be maintained? Is there an automated way that someone can be notified with parnters join or leave this program so that this list can be updated?

<!--Rakesh, our style guidelines ask us to use the term ISV only we are referring to organizations that are truly ISVs. The preferred terms are "partner" or "provider" instead of "ISV". Do we consider organizations that create connectors as partners/providers/ISVs? -->
