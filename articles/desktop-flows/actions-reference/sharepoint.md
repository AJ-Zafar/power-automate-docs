# SharePoint (preview)

SharePoint is a type of actions that invokes the [SharePoint connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/sharepointonline/) from within desktop flows instead of running locally on the desktop. This connector is the same that is used across Power Automate cloud flows, PowerApps, and Logic Apps. It uses the same parameters and returns the same type of data. 

## Prerequisites and limitations

- During preview, you need an Attended with RPA license.

- Sharing desktop flows with SharePoint cloud actions isn't supported. Co-owners won't be able to run such desktop flows unless they overwrite the connection references with their own. **Users** with read access are unable to run such flows. 

- DLPs that include SharePoint cloud actions aren't enforced within desktop flows. During preview, machine administrators can disable the SharePoint actions by modifying the [appropriate registry setting](governance.md#prevent-power-automate-for-desktop-from-running-flows-containing-cloud-connectors). 

## Why should I use SharePoint actions inside desktop flows instead of cloud flows? 

Users can still combine SharePoint actions with the **Run a flow built with Power Automate for desktop** action.

However, SharePoint actions inside desktop flows improve performance and ease of use for users that need to loop between cloud and desktop actions. 

## List of SharePoint actions

- Get file content by path 
- Get folder by path 
- Get file metadata by path 
- Create file 
- Update file 
- Delete file 
- List folder 

## Getting started with SharePoint actions in Desktop flow 

### How to download the content of a SharePoint folder 

1. Create a SharePoint connection reference in any solution.

1. Download the [latest Power Automate for desktop version](../install.md).

1. Create a new desktop flow.

1. Find the **SharePoint (preview)** group of actions in the flow designer.

1. Drag and drop the **List folder** action in the workspace. 

1. [STEPS WILL BE ADDED HERE WHEN I HAVE A BUILD]

1. Now, you can further process the local files using other actions. For example, you can run Excel macros to those files, save them, and upload them back to SharePoint. 

### How to upload a local file to SharePoint 

1. Create a SharePoint connection reference in any solution.

1. Download the [latest Power Automate for desktop version](../install.md).
s
1. Create a new desktop flow.

1. Deploy the **Convert file to binary data** action and select the desired file on your local drive. The action stores the converted file in the **BinaryData** variable.

1. Find the **SharePoint (preview)** group of actions in the flow designer and deploy the **Create file** action in the workspace. 

1. Select an existing connection reference and fill in the required parameters. Here's an example about how to fill the fields: 

    > ![IMPORTANT]
    > Don't forget to add the appropriate file extension after the file name.

    - **Site address**: <https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename>
    - **File path**: /Shared Documents/MyFolderName
    - **File name**: myfilename.xlsx 
    - **File content**: %BinaryData%

## How to fill actionâ€™s input fields

Until dynamic suggestions of input fields become available, here's guidance on what data to fill in for each action. 

>![NOTE}
>Another way to see which properties are expected as input and output is to create a cloud flow with the same action and observe its dynamic data properties. To find more information regarding the SharePoint cloud actions, refer to [SharePoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/sharepointonline/).
