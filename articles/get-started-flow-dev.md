# Start to build with Microsoft Flow #
Extend your application Microsoft Flow in these ways, among others:

- create and connect to a custom API
- share that API with all users of Microsoft Flow
- embed the flow experience from within an app
- leverage all the developer APIs so that users can interact with Microsoft Flow in the best way for them

**Prerequisites**

- An account on [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com)
- A work or school email address

## Create a custom API ##

When you have a web service that you want to be able to automate with Microsoft Flow you will first need to build a Custom API. Registering a custom API teaches Microsoft Flow about the characterstics of your web API, including the authentication it requires, the triggers and actions it supports, and the parameters and outputs for each of those actions.

[Follow this tutorial to register a custom API](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/register-custom-api/). Once you register it you can share it inside of your organization to have others help you test it out.

## Share a custom API with all Microsoft Flow users ##
After you fully tested your Custom API, start the review process by sending this information to flowdev@service.microsoft.com:

- A swagger file that represents your API and any authentication information
- An icon for your connector
- A description of your API
- Approximately 10 ideas for how your API could benefit other users through templates

Once you submit this information Micosoft will begin the review process to assess your APIs function in Microsoft Flow and Microsoft PowerApps. 

## Embed the flow experience in your web site or application ##

Finally, you can embed Microsoft Flow from within your app to enable deep, in-context integration between your application and all the other services that Microsoft Flow supports. You can integrate into your web site or application:

- Browse all of the templates that relate to your service and let users select a template
- Manage the flows that users have related to your application

[Follow this tutorial for more information about how to embed Microsoft Flow within an app](embed-flow-dev.md).
