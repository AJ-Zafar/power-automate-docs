# Sharing and Connectors Admin Analytics Reports

Organizations need insights into how how app are used, and who's using them. The Admin analytics sharing and connectors reports provide insight into how users are using Microsoft Flow within your tenant. 

From a sharing perspective, you can learn who your app champions are and then empower them to provide even more automated solutions for your organization. The connectors report identifies Microsoft, third party, and custom connectors that are in use within your organization.
