# Prebuilt solution available for integrating SAP with Power Platform (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

While custom SAP solutions can be built from scratch in the Power Platform, it can be a very cumbersome process because SAP is a very complex system.

To enable you to not only quickly and effectively connect your SAP system to the Power Platform, but to also be able to start communicating workflow data between the two systems, a prebuilt solution is available for you to import into Power Apps.

## What is in the prebuilt SAP Integration solution?

The prebuilt SAP Integration solution contains the following:

- Power Apps that enable users to have a streamlined view of core SAP ERP business functions.
- Power Automate flows that work behind the scenes automating processes.
- New technical features that support the user experience.

Once the solution has been imported into Power Apps, click on **Apps** in the left-side panel. you can go into the canvas apps pages will appear clustered into modules that match SAP business functions. All of the other objects in the solution support the functionality
