# Create flows from within the create tab

The create tab within the Power Automate Teams app lets you create flows from templates or from scratch.

## Creating a flow from a Teams optimized template
By default the Power Automate app shows you flows that have been specifically created for Teams and enable a simple creation experience. 

You can always switch filters on the top right to view all Flow templates instead as well.

Following steps walk you through creating a flow from a template:
1. Click on any template in the page
2. If the template is a teams optimized template this brings up a dialog that lets you rename the flow and sets up the connections necessary for the flow

3. After setting up the connections click next to get a list of parameters that are necessary for the flow to function and click create flow

Note at any point if you wish to see the full flow you can clikc on "Edit in Advanced Mode" to see the full editor.

4. You're all set! You will get a confirmation screen saying your flow was successfully created and the flow will show up in the Home tab.

>[!NOTE]
>Flows created from within the Power Automate app in Teams are always created in your default environment. You can also access the flow from the Power Automate portal.

## Creating a flow from scratch
If you don't wish to use a template you can always create a flow from scratch. To do so just click the "Create from blank" option on the top right.

This will bring up the full flow editor experience within Teams.

## Known issues
Any flow you create from within the app is also tied to the defaul environment.
