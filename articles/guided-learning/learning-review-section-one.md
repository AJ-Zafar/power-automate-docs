# Review the first section

Let's do a quick review of what you learned in the first section.

**Microsoft Flow** is a service to create automated workflows between your favorite **web applications and services**.  You can also connect to **on-premise data sources**.

**Flow** provides many **pre-built templates** to get up and running quickly, or you **create your own flows from scratch**.   

There are several building blocks to **Microsoft Flow**, including **services**, **triggers**, **actions**, and **conditions**.  In combination with more advanced components, like **loops**, you can create robust, intelligent automation that connects your various data sources and destinations.

The easiest way to get started with Flow is to **use the templates**.  Once you're comfortable with templates, you should also **play around with some blank flows**.
