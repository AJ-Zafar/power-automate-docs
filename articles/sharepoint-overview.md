# Use SharePoint and Power Automate to build workflows

Power Automate is deeply integrated with Microsoft SharePoint. You can start with any of the more than [100 SharePoint templates](https://flow.microsoft.com/templates/) or create your own flow that integrates with SharePoint from scratch.

## Top SharePoint workflow scenarios

Here are some of the top scenarios in which you can use Power Automate with SharePoint:

### Approval workflows

- Route finished documents to a [team for approval](./customize-sharepoint-page-approvals.md).
- Create [SharePoint reminder flows](create-sharepoint-reminder-flows.md).
- Create a [flow for a list or library in SharePoint or OneDrive.](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-flow-for-a-list-or-library-in-sharepoint-or-onedrive-a9c3e03b-0654-46af-a254-20252e580d01)
- [Edit a flow for a list in SharePoint.](https://support.microsoft.com/office/edit-a-flow-for-a-list-in-sharepoint-b6678daa-2c82-44eb-be3f-2a9cb56301e8)


### IT department wants to track changes in meta data on files

- Create a record in Microsoft Dynamics CRM when a list item gets added to a SharePoint list.
- Copy new members from MailChimp lists to SharePoint lists.
- Move files to different folders after theyâ€™re approved in SharePoint.
- Create an item in SharePoint when a new order is added in Salesforce.


## SharePoint triggers and actions

Here is a partial list of the [SharePoint triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/business-apps/power-automate/sharepoint-connector-actions-triggers#sharepoint-triggers) you can use to start flows.

Once your flow starts, you can use any of the more than [40 *actions*](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/business-apps/power-automate/sharepoint-connector-actions-triggers#sharepoint-actions) to manipulate your SharePoint list members:

Whether you start with a SharePoint template or begin from scratch, using Power Automate to create automation features is intuitive.
