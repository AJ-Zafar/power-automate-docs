# Import a solution

After you've exported your solution, you can import it into any environment that meets the prerequisites. Follow these steps to import a solution:

1. Sign into Microsoft Flow, and then select **Solutions** from the navigation bar.

1. Find, and then select the solution that you want to import.
1. Select **Open**.

    You should now see the **Import Solution Package** page similar to this image:

    If there are no errors, the importation completes within a few moments.
