# Manage modern approval requests

## Request an approval

[!INCLUDE [INCLUDEDCONTENT](../includes/request-vacation-approval.md)]

Your request should resemble this image:

![vacation request](./media/sequential-modern-approvals/vacation-request.png)

## View pending approval requests

[!INCLUDE [INCLUDEDCONTENT](../includes/view-pending-approvals.md)]

## Pre-approve a request

[!INCLUDE [INCLUDEDCONTENT](../includes/approve-request-from-different-locations.md)]

## Approve the request

The steps to approve a request are identical to the steps to [pre-approve a request](modern-approvals-sequential.md/#Pre-approve-a-request)

Note: The final approver gets the vacation request only after the request has been pre-approved.

## Reject a request
