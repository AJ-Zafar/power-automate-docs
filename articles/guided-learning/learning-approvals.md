# Approval requests

In addition to helping you **receive notifications**, **copy files**, and **collect data**, Microsoft Flow can also help you **streamline your approval processes**.

## Vacation scenario

Letâ€™s imagine that you are the **manager** of a team and you ask your employees to create **vacation requests** in a **SharePoint list**. Now you want to build an **approval process** around these list items so that new vacation requests are **quickly processed** and the requestor is **automatically notified**.  

## SharePoint and Microsoft Flow

**SharePoint** has Microsoft Flow **built-in**.  From your **SharePoint list**, click the **Flow** drop down, and then **Create a flow**.

In the **menu on the right**, look for a **template** like this.

![Approval Template](./media/learning-approvals/approval-template.png)

## Using the template

The **SharePoint** trigger in the template comes **pre-populated** with your list information.  All you need to do is add an **email address** for the **approver**.  Notice that it **doesn't change the original SharePoint item**.  For that, we'll need to add the **SharePoint - Update item** action.

What about the **if no** branch of of *Send emailScope*?  By default, it does nothing.  You might want to add an action to send the author of the request a message telling them their request was rejected.
