    Kit

2.  Create a new scale configuration.

To create a new scale configuration:

1.  Go to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

2.  On the left pane, select **Solutions**.

3.  Select the Starter Kit solution, navigate to Apps then launch the **AVD
    Integration Configuration App**

4.  Select **New scaling configuration** in the home page.

6.  Select the Environment you want to create the orchestration Flow in.

    Azure Service Management).
