# Configuring an action

**Power Automate Desktop** actions consist of two main segments:
- The input parameters 
- The produced variables

The input parameters determine the way an action functions and the data it gets as input. The data can be hardcoded values or variables.

To use a variable as a parameter, select the icon on the field's right side and select the respective variable.

The produced variables hold the outcomes of the action for later use. All the output variables are displayed on the bottom part of the action's properties.

In case an output variable isn't needed for later use, select the icon on the left side of it and select ***Not needed**.
