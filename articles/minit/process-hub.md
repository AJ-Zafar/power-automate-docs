## Views

A view is the representation of a single process you can work with on your own or in cooperation with your colleagues. View stores all your settings for the analysis of the process. If you want to analyze one process from several viewpoints, just create multiple views.

### View Tile

The view tile contains view name, view state preview, date and time of the last modification, indicators of whether it is private/public view, and the overall number of comments in the view discussion.

It also contains an identifier of unsaved changes. This is indicated by the circular icon to the left of the view name, which changes colour:

- **RED** – unsaved changes in the view

- **BLUE** – the view is saved

- **ORANGE **- unsaved changes in the view and view is not updated to the actual process version

- **VIOLET **- the view is not updated to the actual process version

### Opening a View

To open a view, just click its tile. If the view is not updated to the actual process version user will be notified.

### Process and View Organization

The center of the screen is dedicated to the list of processes and process views. It is possible to organize the list in 3 ways, clicking the icons on the right side of the screen:

:::image type="content" alt-text="media/image-1.png" source="media/image-1.png":::

- **Processes** – grouped view in which a process is indicated by the name and all corresponding views are located below the process. The structure is collapsible/expandable by clicking the circle icon next to the process name.

- **Views** – plain list of view tiles from all processes.

- **List** – a view similar to Processes but without the view tiles. Views have a form of an item in a list with more details.

You can sort the selected display form by clicking the **sort indicator** on the top of the list. Availability of sorting criteria depends on the selected display form.

## Process Management

The process hub is used to manage the processes. The management menu is accessible by clicking the **…** icon next to the process name.

The menu contains the following options:
