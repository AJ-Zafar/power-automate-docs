# Review the second section

Let's review what we've learned.

**Microsoft Flow** makes it easy to:

* Get **push notifications** on our mobile devices in response to events on your favorite web services.
* **Copy and move files** between online storage services.
* **Collect data** and telemetry from services.
* Create an **approval workflow with SharePoint**.

## What's next?
Congratulations! You have finished the second section of Microsoft Flow Guided Learning. Next we'll look at managing flows in the web portal and the mobile apps.
