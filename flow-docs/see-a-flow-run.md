# Watch your flows in action

To ensure that your flows run as you expect, perform the starting action, and review the inputs and outputs that each step in your flow generates.

1. Create or update a flow, but leave the designer open after you select **Create flow** or **Update flow**.
   
     For example, [create a flow](get-started-logic-flow.md) that sends mail whenever someone tweets using the **#azure** hashtag.
2. Perform the starting action for your flow.
   
    For example, send a tweet that contains the **#azure** hashtag.
   
    The starting action and each subsequent step indicates whether it succeeded and how long it took

3. Select an individual trigger or action to show its inputs and outputs.

4. Select **Edit flow** to make more changes, or select **Done** if the flow works as you expect.
