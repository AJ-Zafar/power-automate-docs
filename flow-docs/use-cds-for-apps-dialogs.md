# Use CDS for Apps dialogs for guided processes (Deprecated)

[Dialogs are deprecated](/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming#dialogs-are-deprecated). You should replace dialogs with business process flows or canvas apps. More information: [Replace dialogs with business process flows or canvas apps](replace-dialogs.md) 

Dialogs are the synchronous or interactive processes in that collect and process information by using step-by-step scripts to direct users through a process. For example, you can create dialogs to act as a guide for your service representatives for case resolution and case escalation. Similarly, you can create dialogs for standardizing sales processes such as opportunity qualification and lead scoring. For more information, see [Use dialogs for guided processes](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/use-dialogs-guided-processes) in the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Developer Guide.

## Differences between workflows and dialogs

The following table provides information about the differences between CDS for Apps workflows and dialogs.  


| Workflows     |    Dialogs      |
|---------------|--------------|
|                                                                                                  Can be either started by a user or can be automated.                                                                                                   |                                                                                          Must be started by a user.                                                                                          |
|                                  Are asynchronous or real-time processes, and do not require user input to run to completion. Asynchronous processes run in the background while real-time processes run immediately.                                   | Are real-time processes that require user input to run to completion. When you run these processes, a wizard-like interface is presented to you so you can make appropriate selections to run the processes. |
|                                                    The entity that stores the details about a running asynchronous workflow is `AsyncOperation` while a `Process` is used for a real-time workflow.                                                     |                                                       The entity that stores information generated by a running dialog is the `ProcessSession` entity.                                                       |
|                  Triggers are supported for workflows. For a list of supported triggers, see [Supported Types, Triggers, and Entities for Processes (Workflows and Dialogs)](developer/supported-types-triggers-entities-actions-processes.md).                   |                                                                                   Triggers are not supported for dialogs.                                                                                    |
