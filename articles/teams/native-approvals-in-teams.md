# Approvals in Microsoft Teams

Approvals in Microsoft Teams is a native Teams application lets you easily create, manage, and share approvals directly from your hub for teamwork. You can quickly start an approval flow from the same place you send a chat, in a channel conversation, or from the Approvals app itself. Just select an approval type, add details, attach files, and choose approvers. Once submitted, approvers are notified and can review and act on the request.

These approvals are triggered directly with the Power Automate infrastructure and don't require a flow with an approvals action. Though if you wish to modify your approvals, by creating custom pre-approval or post-approvals action you can always create a flow for your approval. 

## Use the Approvals app in Teams

1. Sign into [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com)

1. Select **More added apps (...)**, search for **Approvals**, and then select the **Approvals** app

>[!TIP]
>If you do not see the Approvals app in the more apps menu it is likely that your Teams Administrator has disabled the app in your tenant. Please contat your Teams administrator to enable the Approvals app from the Teams Admin center (pending link from Teams documentation)
