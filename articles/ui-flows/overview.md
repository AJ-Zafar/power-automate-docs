UI flows provides Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capabilities to Power Automate. You can use UI flows to automate repetitive tasks in Windows and Web applications. UI flows records and plays back user interface actions (clicks, keyboard input, etc.) for applications that don't have easy-to-use or complete APIs available.

You can jump right in:

- [Create and test UI flows for desktop](create-desktop.md) 
- [Create and test UI flows for Web applications](create-web.md)  

### UI flows or connectors?

With Power Automate, you can automate both modern applications with APIs, or legacy applications with incomplete or missing APIs. You can even combine legacy apps, modern apps, and manual processes in a single automation.

| **Application type**      | **Feature** | **Benefits**     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Modern apps with APIs| Connectors                 | High reliability with software UI updates |
| Legacy apps (no APIs)          | UI flows                    | Easy to create. Works if no API is available.   |


You will find your UI flows alongside automated, button, scheduled, and business process flows in [**My flows**](manage.md).
