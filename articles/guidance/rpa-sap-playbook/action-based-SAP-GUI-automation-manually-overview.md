# Action-based SAP GUI automation â€“ using manually defined actions

With the addition of Power Automate Desktop, it's quicker and easier than ever to develop delightful, timesaving low-code SAP GUI automations. Power Automate Desktop enables you to build from simple to highly sophisticated end-to-end automation solutions. To showcase this, we'll perform the steps outlined under point [4 Sample SAP scenario for testing](#_Sample_SAP_scenario) using Power Automate Actions and do some minor tweaks afterwards in the designer. To make our automation dynamic, we need to create some variables first, which we'll use to fill in data like street, city, country, and also system variables to connect to your SAP system etc.
