# Share button flows from your mobile app

You can share [button flows](./introduction-to-button-flows.md) with other users or groups in your organization. When you share a button flow, the person or group you share with can run and trigger your flow. Sharing buttons improves the efficiency since others can use a button that's already created by someone else. You can manage all button flow sharing activities from the Microsoft Flow mobile app.

>[AZURE.NOTE]All shared buttons run using the *connections* that the creator of the button flow used to design the button. However, persons or groups with whom a button flow has been shared cannot access the credentials used in these connections.

## What you need to share button flows

To share buttons, you need the following:

- An acount with access to [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com)
- A mobile device with the Microsoft Flow app installed
- A group or user with whom to share your button

## Monitor the run history of a shared button

All run history, including the runs initiated by a person with whom a button flow was shared, appear only on the **Activity** tab of the button flow creator's Microsoft Flow mobile app. So, if you need to view the history of the runs you've made (with a button that is shared with you), you would have to coordinate with the creator of the shared button.

## Find buttons shared with me

### From the share alert

You will receive an alert on the **Buttons** tab whenever a new button flow is shared with you.

     ![new button shared with me](./media/share-button-flows/1.png)

### From the Get More list

You can find all buttons that have been shared with you on the **Get More** list. You can see the name of the person who created the button flow as well as the date the button flow was shared with you. To use a button flow from this list, simply tap it; tapping it will immediately add the button to the **Buttons** tab of the Microsoft Flow app. You can then use the button flow from the **Buttons* tab, just like any other button flow that's listed there.

## Stop using a shared button

If you no longer want to use a shared button, you can remove it from the **Buttons** tab by taking the following steps from the **Buttons** tab:
