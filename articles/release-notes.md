# Release notes #

## Top questions ##

1. My flow failed. How do I fix it?

	1. Identify the failure. Start by going to the notifications icon at the top of the web portal, or selecting the **Activity** tab in the mobile app. You should see your flow there, and you can select it.
	- You are now looking at the flow details. Find the step with the red exclamation icon and you should see the error message for your flow there.
	- Depending on the error message, you should be able to **Edit** the flow and fix it. [Read more here about how to fix common flow failures](fix-flow-failures.md).

1. How do I use an advanced condition or a formula?
	- Read about [adding conditions](add-a-condition.md).
	- If you want multiple cases in a flow, click or tap **Add condition** from inside of an existing condition.
	- Create an advanced formula by referencing [a function in Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/logic/definition-language).

1. How does licensing work with Office 365?
	- If you're an Office 365 user, you get full access through the Flow for Office 365 plan. For more information, see the [pricing plans for Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing/) .
	- If you're an administrator, see information about [licensing for Microsoft Flow](organization-q-and-a.md), including with Office 365.

## Known issues and resolutions ##
1. Flows created during preview that use the Microsoft Common Data Service:
	- Have been moved to an environment dedicated to that database. Select the environment for that database in the top-right of the screen. [Learn more](environments-overview-maker.md).
	- In the flow designer, these flows will display a long string of numbers and letters in any actions that use it. Your flow should continue to function as you expect.

1. SharePoint lists on My Sites and that aren't of type *Custom List* aren't supported. To work around this issue, create a custom list on a standard SharePoint site.

1. SQL stored procedures can't be run on on-premises SQL Servers. Only SQL Azure supports stored procedures at this time.

1. Do-until cards have rendering errors that make it difficult to reference content from arrays.

1. Document Metadata isn't returned from triggers on SharePoint document libraries.

1. Flows can't write to Lookup, Choice, People and Groups, and Taxonomy fields in SharePoint lists. We recommend using a simple string field until this is corrected.

1. File triggers won't fire for files being added inside of nested folders inside the folder you select.
