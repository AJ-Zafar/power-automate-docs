# Get started

A good way to get started is to use a template that's suited to your business scenario. You can choose from our collection of templates to find the right one to accomplish your scenario. [Search our templates](https://flow.microsoft.com/templates/) or browse by category to find your scenario, and then follow steps in the template to create a flow from the template.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Screenshot of the templates screen.](..\media\forms\templates-screen.png "Search for a template")

Perhaps you found a template that is similar to what you are looking for, but isn't quite right for your scenario. No problem - just create your own flow from that template and tweak the it to your liking. You can extend a flow created from template by adding, editing, removing trigger and actions. You can [copy paste actions](/power-automate/multi-step-logic-flow#copy-and-paste-actions) in the same flow or across flows to speed up the process.

Can't find a template you like? You can create a flow from scratch and connect the services you want to use. To learn more, go to [How to create a flow from scratch](/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow).
