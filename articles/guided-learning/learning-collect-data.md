# Collecting data

In addition to being able to **get notifications** and **copy files**, **Microsoft Flow** also enables you to **collect data**.  This can be useful for **analytics**, like with **Power BI**.  

## Sources and destinations, triggers and actions

When collecting data, your **trigger** can be any of a variety of services, such as **Twitter**, your **Office 365 Email**, or the **Common Data Service**.  Each one of these services has their own **dynamic properties** that represent **fields** you can populate in your **destination**.

Some **common destinations** you can store data in include **Excel**, **SQL Server**, **SharePoint lists**, and **Google Sheets**.  You can also use the **Common Data Service**.
