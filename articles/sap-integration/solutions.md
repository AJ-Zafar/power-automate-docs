# Understand prebuilt solution available for integrating SAP with Power Platform (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

SAP ERP is a complex business system that maintains data and manages business processes. It is relied upon by many businesses around the world and requires specialized knowledge—not just to design and implement—but to use. Integrating with such a complex business system has posed many challenges for business that want to integrate its data with other systems to extend its capabilities.

The prebuilt SAP Integration solution establishes an easier way to connect your SAP system to the Power Platform and its prebuilt Power Apps and Power Automate flows can work immediately with the core SAP ERP workflows that most businesses utilize.
