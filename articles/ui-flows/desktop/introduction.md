# Introduction to Power Automate Desktop

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Power Automate Desktop broadens the existing robotic process automation (RPA) capabilities in Power Automate. In conjunction with UI flows, you can automate all repetitive desktop processes. Use prebuilt drag-and-drop actions or record your own UI flows to run later.

Itâ€™s quicker and easier than ever to automate with the new intuitive Power Automate Desktop. 

Power Automate Desktop allows you to automate both legacy applications, such as terminal emulators and modern web and desktop applications, Excel files, and folders. Interact with the machine using application UI elements, images, or coordinates. 

Begin your journey in Power Automate Desktop by [creating a Power Automate Desktop flow](create-flow-console.md). 

You 'll find the list of actions available in the [Actions reference](actions-reference.md).
