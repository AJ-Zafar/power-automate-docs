# Overview of the different types of flows

Power Automate is a service that you can use to automate repetitive tasks to bring efficiencies to any organizations.

You can create [cloud flows](), [desktop flows](), or [business process flows](business-process-flows-overview.md).

## Cloud flows

Create a cloud flow when you want your automation to be triggered either automatically, instantly, or via a schedule.

| **Flow type**                                                                       | **Use case**                                                                                  | **Automation target**                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Automated flows](get-started-logic-flow.md)                 | Create an automation that is triggered by an event such as arrival of an email from a specific person, or a mention of your company in social media.| [Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/) for cloud or on-premises services connect your accounts and enable them to talk to each other. |
| [Instant flows](introduction-to-button-flows.md)              | Start an automation with a click of a button. You can automate for repetitive tasks from your Desktop or Mobile devices. For example, instantly send a reminder to the team with a push of a button from your mobile device.                      |     Wide range of tasks such as requesting an approval, an action in Teams or SharePoint.                                                                                |
| [Scheduled flows](run-scheduled-tasks.md)                    | Schedule an automation such as daily data upload to SharePoint or a database.             |Tasks that need to be automated on a schedule.                                                                            |
