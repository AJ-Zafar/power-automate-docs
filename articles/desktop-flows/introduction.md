# Introduction to desktop flows 

Power Automate Desktop broadens the existing robotic process automation (RPA) capabilities in Power Automate. As part of desktop flows, you can automate all repetitive desktop processes. Use prebuilt drag-and-drop actions or record your own desktop flows to run later.

Itâ€™s quicker and easier than ever to automate with the new intuitive Power Automate Desktop. It comes along with a brand new flow designer with a wide range of actions including files and folders, Excel and desktop automation capabilities.

Power Automate Desktop allows you to automate both legacy applications, such as terminal emulators and modern web and desktop applications, Excel files, and folders. Interact with the machine using application UI elements, images, or coordinates. 

You can also create desktop flows using the alternative solutions [legacy Windows recorder (V1) and Selenium IDE](overview.md)

## Next Steps

- Learn how to [set up Power Automate Desktop](setup.md).

- Begin your journey in Power Automate Desktop by [creating a Power Automate Desktop flow](create-flow.md). 

- Get familiar with the [console](console.md) and the [flow designer](flow-designer.md), which are part of Power Automate Desktop. 

- You'll find the list of actions available in the [Actions reference](actions-reference.md).
