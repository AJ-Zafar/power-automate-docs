# Getting started with Power Automate in Windows 11

Windows 11 comes with the Power Automate desktop app, a low-code application that enables home and business users to optimize their workflows and automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks. 

Any user can build flows without the need for coding experience. A wide variety of pre-made actions and the ability to record interactions as steps make RPA intuitive for both regular and power users.

The Power Automate desktop app can be used to automate tasks on Windows and any Microsoft or third-party application. Users can build flows that handle virtually any desktop task, such as populating forms, extracting data from desktop and web applications, interacting with Excel worksheets, and sending emails.
