# Solutions available for integrating SAP with Power Platform (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

You can integrate SAP with your existing Power Platform solutions that consist of such as canvas apps, model-driven apps created using Power Apps, and flows created using Power Automate. While such solutions can be custom built from scratch, there are several solutions available for you to choose from that allow a faster and effective integration of your existing SAP deployments with Power Platform.
