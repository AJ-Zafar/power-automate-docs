### Opportunities Post Publishing


**Build Templates** : Flow enables you to build and publish a series of out-of-box solutions called Templates. Templates are pre-built flows that you can directly leverage or customize further. 

**Extend Your App** : Leverage the Microsoft platform to easily add capabilities and business value to your apps – from innovative, intelligent features to enhanced capabilities. 

To make it easier for business users to configure a flow from the context of your app, you can embed a list of Templates within your own app or web site.  

**Publish on App Source** : Using the connector, you can also build a PowerApp to publish and share on AppSource. [Learn more](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/tutorials/getting-started/)
