# Guided Learning for the mobile app for Microsoft Flow

In this lesson, we will be covering the Flow Mobile App and its capabilities. We will go over The **Activity Feed**, **Browsing**, **Buttons** and **Managing Flows** from the app.

First, you’ll need to **download** and **install** the Microsoft Flow App from your app store.

![Activity Feed](./media/learning-mobile-app/open-mobile-app.png)

Once it's installed, **open it** up and **sign in**.

As we can see here, when you open the app, you land on the **Activity Feed**.

The **Activity Feed** is the spot to see what’s happening with your flows while you are on the go and may not have access to your computer for a full experience.

For instance, if you **click** into any of these items, you can get a **closer look** at that flows **last activity**, whether it succeeded or failed to run, and if it failed, which step it failed on.

![Last activity](./media/learning-mobile-app/last-activity.png)

As we can see here, this flow succeded in both steps.

![Click browse button](./media/learning-mobile-app/click-browse-button.png)

From here, go ahead and **click** the **Buttons** icon.




## How Flows are Kicked Off
   
   Buttons are flows that are kicked off with a manual action. For instance, one of my buttons is **Send a Working from Home email to your Manager**.
   You could use this one if you live far away and on days the traffic is a mess!


![last activity](./media/learning-mobile-app/click-browse-button.png)


Use the **Browse** button to check out templates for more button flows to add to your collection. 

![ Click Browse button](./media/learning-mobile-app/browse-to-add-more-flows.png)

Let’s go ahead and see how that works.

![ Click Browse button](./media/learning-mobile-app/send-reminder-in-10min.png)

**Choose** the **Send myself a reminder in 10 minutes** button flow.



![ Click use this template](./media/learning-mobile-app/use-this-template.png)

**Click** the **Use this template** button.

![Click Create](./media/learning-mobile-app/create.png)

And then, **click Create**.

![Saved flow](./media/learning-mobile-app/saved-flow.png)

The flow is saved, 

![The flow is saved](./media/learning-mobile-app/flow-is-saved.png)

created, 

![Details of flow](./media/learning-mobile-app/flow-details.png)

and here it is in your collection.


![In our buttons](./media/learning-mobile-app/saved-button.png)

Here it is in your buttons, and you can go ahead and **click it**, and in 10 minutes, you'll get a **reminder**.

See how simple it is to **add additional buttons** to your collection?
Now, what if you suddenly decide that you don’t want one of your Flows anymore?


![Buttons icon](./media/learning-mobile-app/click-buttons-icon.png)


**Click** on the **Flows** button which is essentially the mobile management area for your flows.



![Unwanted flow](./media/learning-mobile-app/dont-want.png)

Now, **click** on this **flow** as you don’t really want this one anymore and we see that you have a few options.



![Enable or disable](./media/learning-mobile-app/disable-delete.png)

You can enable it or disable it by **pressing the Enable flow** toggle, and you can also delete it by **pressing the Delete** button.


![Run history](./media/learning-mobile-app/you-can-delete-it.png)

You can **enable** or **disable** the flow on the go, you can edit the flow, in case you can make it useful to yourself again, and you can see the **run history** of the flow to get an idea of its successful and non-successful runs.

## Next Lesson

In our next lesson, we will look at the **Create a Button** flow.
