# Preview: Introduction to UI flows
[!INCLUDE [view-pending-approvals](../includes/cc-rebrand.md)]

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]


## Introduction

UI flows provides Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to Microsoft Flow. You can use UI flows to automate repetitive tasks in Windows and Web applications. UI flows records and plays back user interface actions (clicks, keyboard input, etc.) for applications that don't have easy-to-use or complete APIs available.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - A preview feature may have limited availability and restricted functionality. A preview feature is available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

<!--## UI flows overview

You will find your UI flows alongside automated, button, scheduled and business process flows in **My flows** tab. -->

You can get a [quick start](create-desktop.md) or
watch a [brief video](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:v:/t/PARIS/ERHYhdoIoGZPkDOFOPU-8-kBuC5hLz75cA1VfKkPFnjx6w)
of how UI flow works with the calculator!

#### UI flows or API?

With Microsoft Flow, you can automate both modern applications with APIs, or legacy applications with incomplete or missing APIs. You can even combine legacy apps, modern apps, and manual processes int a UI flolw.

| **Application type**      | **Microsoft Flow feature** | **Benefits**     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Modern apps with APIs| Connectors                 | High reliability |
| Legacy apps (no APIs)          | UI Flow                    | Easy to create   |
