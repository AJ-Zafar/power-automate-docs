# The admin center

The admin center is the central location where tenant admins and environment admins manage an organizationâ€™s data policies and environments. Any changes you make in the admin center are immediately available to users within the organization.

> [!NOTE]
> The Power Automate admin center is retired and Power Automate admins will be automaticaly redirected to the Microsoft [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac) to manage data policies and environments for Power Automate deployments.

## Access the admin center

## Environments
