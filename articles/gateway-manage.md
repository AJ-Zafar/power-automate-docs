# Manage an on-premises data gateway #
Install and manage on-premises data gateway to securely integrate a variety of cloud-based apps with your on-premise data and applications via Microsoft Flow.

**Prerequisites**

- the user name and password that you used to [sign up](sign-up-sign-in.md) for Microsoft Flow
- administrative permissions on a gateway.

	You have these permissions by default for each gateway that you install, and an administrator of another gateway can grant you these permissions for that gateway.

## View accessible gateways ##
1. In the top header of [Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com), click or tap the **Account menu**, and then click or tap **My gateways**.

   ![Gateways under Manage section][1]

   **Note**: Gateways that are you are granted access to through PowerApps, will also show up in this list.

## Install a Gateway ##   

1. If you don't have a gateway, click or tap **Add a gateway** in the upper-right corner (or [click here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820580&clcid=0x409)) to download the gateway installer. Run the installer on your machine and once successfully installed you should see it show up in the list.
