# Known issues in process advisor

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

**Unable to access process advisor**

If you cannot see process advisor in Power Automate, receive error messages, or if you can’t access the home page, verify the following:

- You have a Power Automate License.

   If you don’t have a license, you can activate your trial license from **Desktop flows** in Power Automate.
- You have access to the Power Automate environment and the permissions required by process advisor described in the [Security](process-advisor-security.md) section.
- Your browser has the feature to accept 3rd party cookies enabled.
  You can enable it in your browser settings.
  
**Unable to import a process**

Process advisor doesn't fully support exporting and importing processes between environments. However, you can import or export processes by adding the processes you want to export along with all related recordings to a solution, and then importing them into another environment. 

>[!TIP]
>Analyze the processes in the new environment to validate that there are no issues.

We'll continue to add issues here, but if you are experiencing an issue not mentioned here, check the **Process advisor community forums**.
