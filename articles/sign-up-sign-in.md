# Sign up and sign in for Microsoft Flow #
Before you can create a flow, sign up by using an email address from your work or school. If you've never used an online Microsoft product with that account, you'll need to take a few moments to register it. Select **Sign up free**. After signing up, start to discover the power of flows.

If you've used an online Microsoft product with your account, select **Sign in**.

**Note**: As of this writing, Microsoft Flow doesn't support personal email addresses, such as those that end in **@outlook** or **@gmail**. If you really want to use that kind of account, [tell us why](address).

## Sign up ##

1. In [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com), select **Sign up free** in the upper-right corner of the website.

## Next steps ##
- [Start with a template](get-started-logic-template.md), which is a pre-built flow that's set up for you.
- [Start from blank](get-started-logic-flow.md) if you already have a process in mind and can't find a template for it.
