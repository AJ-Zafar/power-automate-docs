# Known issues in process advisor

## Unable to access process advisor

If you can't see process advisor in Power Automate, receive error messages, or if you can’t access the home page, verify that:

- You have a Power Automate License.

   If you don’t have a license, you can activate your trial license from **Desktop flows** in Power Automate.
- You have access to the Power Automate environment and the permissions required by process advisor described in the [Security](process-advisor-security.md) section.
- Your browser has the feature to accept third party cookies enabled.
  You can enable it in your browser settings.
  
We'll continue to add issues here. If you're experiencing an issue not mentioned, check the **Process advisor community forums**.
