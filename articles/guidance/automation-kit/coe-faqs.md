# Frequently asked questions about the automation kit setup guidance

This article provides answers to some of the most common questions about the automation kit.

**Question** - What are the datacenter region codes?

**Answer** - These values are crucial when configuring a satelliteâ€™s environment variables. Each region has a different URL. The following is a list of regions and their URLs.

| Region     |            URL           |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Region     | URL                      |
| NAM        | crm.dynamics.com         |
| DEU        | crm.microsoftdynamics.de |
| SAM        | crm2.dynamics.com        |
| CAN        | crm3.dynamics.com        |
| EUR        | crm4.dynamics.com        |
| FRA        | crm12.dynamics.com       |
| APJ        | crm5.dynamics.com        |
| OCE        | crm6.dynamics.com        |
| JPN        | crm7.dynamics.com        |
| IND        | crm8.dynamics.com        |
| GCC        | crm9.dynamics.com        |
| GCC High   | crm.microsoftdynamics.us |
| GBR        | crm11.dynamics.com       |
| ZAF        | crm14.dynamics.com       |
| UAE        | crm15.dynamics.com       |
| GER        | crm16.dynamics.com       |
| CHE        | crm17.dynamics.com       |
| CHN        | crm.dynamics.cn          |

For more information, review [Datacenter regions](/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions).

**Question** - How can the RPA CLI be used to extend the automation CoE?

**Answer** - Read more about how to use the [RPA CLI](https://aka.ms/rpacli).

**Issue** - No organization matches the given dataset: unq0a5fac6XXXXXXXXXXXXX.crm

**Answer** - The issue might be due to a wrongly entered environment variable value for the **Environment Unique Name** of CoE main. If your environment is provisioned in Australia for instance, you need to enter the Australian region suffix to the crm domain. For example, enter **crm6** instead of **crm**. After you fix this, you can turn on all cloud flows.

You can also review [How to change environment variables inside managed solution](./coe-limitations.md#environment-variables-are-not-editable-after-you-import-a-solution) and [Force new values of environment variables when changed manually](./coe-limitations.md#environment-variables-continue-to-use-the-old-values-after-a-manual-change) to learn more.

**Issue** - GetDataverseSolutionArtifacts.Run failed.

**Details** - This error happens inside the Automation Solution Manager app (inside a satellite) when you try to view the  solution artifacts.

**Answer** - First check out these flows.

<!--Todo: what are these?-->
**Get Dataverse Bearer Token (Azure KeyVault Env)**

**Get Dataverse Solution Artifacts**

The error in the flow might be like the following screenshot.

![A screenshot that displays the solution artifacts errors from a run](media/1d0e866fa0bb1c34376cb2cc1bccc829.png)

There could be two main causes of this error.
<!--todo: fix links-->
1. The application user isn't created in the satellite environment.  
    <!-- [Create application user inside satellite environment](#create-application-user-inside-dataverse-per-satellite-env). -->

1. The satellite environment variables aren't configured properly.
   <!-- [Check and confirm all values for your environment variables](#environment-variables). -->
