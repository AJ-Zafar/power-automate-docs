# Watch your flows in action #
To ensure that your flows run as you expect, perform the starting action, and review the inputs and outputs that each step in your flow generates.

1. Create or update a flow, but leave the designer open after you select **Create flow** or **Update flow**.

 	For example, [create a flow](get-started-logic-flow.md) that sends mail whenever someone tweets using the **#azure** hashtag.

1. Perform the starting action for your flow.

	For example, send a tweet that contains the **#azure** hashtag.

	The starting action and each subsequent step indicates whether it succeeded and how long it took
