# Manage approvals on the go

The approvals feature allows you to manage your approval requests while you’re away from your desk. 

You can approve or reject a request directly from the **Approvals** screen. Alternatively, to view more details of an approval request, tap the vertical (**…**) next to a request and select **Details**.
