# Power Automate Desktop flow console

The flow console is the central interface of Power Automate Desktop (PAD).

After signing in, your username will be displayed in the bottom-left corner, while the option to sign out is on the right. The dropdown list allows users to switch environments, in order to access different flows.

## Starting a flow

Users may run any flows available to them through the console, by hovering the cursor over a flow and pressing the "Start" button. The status of the flow is also displayed:

## Editing a flow

Through the console, users may also create a new flow by pressing the "New flow" button, or edit an already existing one by right-clicking on it and selecting "Edit":

In both scenarios, the Flow Designer will be launched; this is where flow creation and editing takes place.
