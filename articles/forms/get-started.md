# Get started

1. Most likely, we already have a template to accomplish your scenario. Find our templates [here](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/templates/) and search for your scenario and follow steps shown to create a flow from template.
1. Found a template that is similar to what you are looking for, but doesnâ€™t do exactly what you are looking for? No problem. Create a flow from that template and tweak the flow to your liking. You can extend a flow created from template by adding, editing, removing trigger and actions. You can [copy paste actions](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-clipboard-in-flow-designer-and-three-new-user-experience-updates/) in the same flow or across flows to speed up the process.
1. Did not find a template? You can create a flow from scratch and connect the services you want. More information: [How to create a flow from scratch](/get-started-logic-flow.md).
