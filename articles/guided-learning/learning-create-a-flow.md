# Guided Learning for Microsoft Flow ##

Welcome back to Guided Learning for Microsoft Flow. In this session, we will show you more of the Microsoft Flow environment, and introduce you to building your first flow.

Getting started with Microsoft Flow is easy, as we have a HUGE number of templates for you to choose from which will help you connect the services you are already using in more meaningful ways.  

## Microsoft Flow Templates ##
Let’s take a look at [the Microsoft Flow website.](https://ms.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/)
 
**Open** the **Templates** menu.

As you scroll through the list, you see that Microsoft Flow allows you to connect to many services.

## Choose a Template ##

To get started, let’s go ahead and choose one of these templates that could be useful.

![Office 365 email](./media/learning-create-a-flow/office-365-email.png)

We are going to use a **template** that will put all of your email attachments into a folder in your OneDrive. Searching for **attachments** through **email** can be time consuming, and this flow saves time by storing all your attachments in one central location.

**Click** the **Save Office 365 email attachments** to OneDrive for business template.


## Create and Administer a Flow ##

This is one of our new, **one click** templates, where we try and only ask relevant questions necessary to **build** the flow without having you deal with the editor screens.
On the template graphic, there is a **detailed description** of what the template does and needs to succeed.

![Save Office 365 email](./media/learning-create-a-flow/save-flow-office-description.png)

You are asked to **provide credentials** for the Office 365 Outlook and SharePoint services. 
If you use both services regularly, you will already be **signed into** them. 

![Click create flow](./media/learning-create-a-flow/click-create-flow.png)

Click **Create Flow**, and Voila! You have the results of the create. 

![Create successful](./media/learning-create-a-flow/create-successful.png)

Flow has created a **folder** in your OneDrive where it will now automatically place every **attachment** that gets emailed to your work email.

![Click my flows](./media/learning-create-a-flow/click-my-flows.png)

**Click My Flows**, and...

![Click the flow](./media/learning-create-a-flow/click-the-flow.png)

**click** the **flow** you just made to see how it works.

![Flow successful](./media/learning-create-a-flow/flow-successful.png)

You see a message that the **flow succeeded**. 

![Run history](./media/learning-create-a-flow/run-history.png)

**Click Succeeded** to see the run history and the results. **All parts** of the flow were successful.


## Important Concepts in Microsoft Flow ##

Some things to know about when building flows. 
Every flow has two key parts, a **trigger**, and one or more **actions**. 
 
You can think of the **trigger** as the starting action for the flow, which can be things like **On new Email** that we have here or, when a **new item** is added, if you happened to be using SharePoint. It can also be a fixed schedule, if we use a trigger called **Recurrence** which we will discuss  later.

![Actions on new email](./media/learning-create-a-flow/trigger-or-action.png)

**Actions** are the activities you want to happen when a **trigger** is invoked. For example, **Create file** will recreate the file in OneDrive.

Other actions could be,  **send** an email, **post** a Tweet, start an **Approval** or many others.
These will all come into play later, as we build our own Flows from scratch. 


## Next Lesson ##

In our next lesson, we will look at the Microsoft Flow mobile app and its capabilities.
