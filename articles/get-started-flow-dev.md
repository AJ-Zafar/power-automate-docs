# Start building with Microsoft Flow #

Do more with Microsoft Flow. You have a range of opportunities to develop with Microsoft Flow, starting from adding a connection to your own custom API, sharing your API with all Microsoft Flow users, embedding the Flow experience from right within your Apps, to having full access to all the developer APIs to interact with Microsoft Flow the way it makes sense for your App users.

**Prerequisites**

- An account on [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com)
- Office 365 credentials

## Create a custom API ##

Make your API work as part of a larger workflow. Follow the steps here at Registering a Custom API, to create a connection to your own custom API.

## Share your custom API with all Microsoft Flow users ##

After successfully creating and testing your API by following the steps here at Registering a Custom API, please submit the following information to flowdev@service.microsoft.com to get started with the review process. 

- A swagger file that represents your API
- An icon for your connector
- A description of the API
- Around ten different Flow template ideas that your API can be used for by Flow users.

## Embed Flow ##

Embedding Microsoft Flow from right within your App enables deep integration between your app and all the other services that are supported by Microsoft Flow. The following APIs are supported today

- Create/Read/Update/Delete operations on a Flow
- Read operation on the list of Flow templates 

Please contact flowdev@service.microsoft.com to get started on embedding Microsoft Flow within your app.
