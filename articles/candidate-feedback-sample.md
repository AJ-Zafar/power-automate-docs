# Candidate feedback sample
**Sample 7 â€“ Candidate Feedback Form**

The **Candidate Feedback Form** sample is an Adaptive Card input form designed
for collecting feedback during an interview loop. We recommend using this with a
shared instant flow button to enable anyone on the team to provide feedback on
candidates during the interview loop. Extend this by recording responses in a
database or other desired data source in support of these additional
opportunities:

-   facilitate review of follow-up suggestions before the next session with the
    candidate

-   facilitate aggregated data review after all responses are recorded

-   notify HR representative with the Hire/No Hire vote count at the end of the
    process
