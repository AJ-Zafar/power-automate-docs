# Introduction

The Microsoft Power Automate Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) Integration Starter Kit
is a set of templates that are designed to help orchestrate and scale Virtual
machines used to run desktop flows. The kit includes a Power Apps and multiple
flows to automate the scaling up and down of machines. The assets part of the
Starter Kit should be seen as a template from which you inherit your individual
solution or can serve as inspiration for implementing your own apps and flows.

You can download the latest version of the Power Automate AVD Starter Kit for the [Github repository](https://github.com/Azure/powerautomate-avd-starter-kit).

# Disclaimer

Although the underlying features and components used to build the kit (such as
Dataverse, admin APIs, and connectors) are fully supported, the kit itself
represents sample implementations of these features. Our customers and community
can use and customize these features to implement admin and governance
capabilities in their organizations.

    section](https://github.com/Azure/powerautomate-avd-starter-kit/issues).
