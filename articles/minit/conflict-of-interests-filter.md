# Conflict of interests filter

Use this filter to expose cases with conflict of interests â€“ a typical example is the violation of rules for assigning roles in performing critical tasks.

By means of the filter, you can specify two sets of events which should/should not have the same value of an attribute. All events from the first group are always compared with all events from the second group. If there is the intersection of the two groups, the filter result will always return all such events.

The sample picture shows a situation where this filter is used to find out if there has ever been invoice accounted by the same person as the one who actually approved it. For this purpose, the filter is set to select all cases where these two activities occurred and were carried out by the same person.
