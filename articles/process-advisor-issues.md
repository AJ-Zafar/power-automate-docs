# Known issues in process advisor

## Unable to access process advisor

If you cannot see process advisor in Power Automate, receive error messages, or if you can’t access the home page, verify the following:

- You have a Power Automate License.

   If you don’t have a license, you can activate your trial license from **Desktop flows** in Power Automate.
- You have access to the Power Automate environment and the permissions required by process advisor described in the [Security](process-advisor-security.md) section.
- Your browser has the feature to accept third party cookies enabled.
  You can enable it in your browser settings.
  
We'll continue to add issues here, but if you are experiencing an issue not mentioned here, check the **Process advisor community forums**.
