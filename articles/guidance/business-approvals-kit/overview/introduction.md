# Overview of the Business Approvals Kit (Experimental)

One of the key use cases that we see across every industry and every department
are approvals. Power Automate allows you to streamline your business by
digitalizing the approval experience.

“Business approvals kit” – is a kit that will accelerate building your approvals
faster than ever - available as an experimental preview. Business approvals kit
is a no-code ready-made template built on top of Power Platform components that
allows your organization to configure sophisticated approvals such as
conditional branching, delegation, admin overrides and more – all without the
need to write a single code – empowering every person in your organization to
"do more with less" for your organizations approval needs.

Organizations require approvals for variety of different business processes such
as expense reporting, work-time management, business travel requests,
procurement orders, sales discounts etc. With Microsoft Power Platform, you can
meet these approval needs by combining components from Microsoft Power Apps and
Microsoft Power Automate. However, as your complexity of your approvals
increases, so does your configuration. In order to quickly set up approvals for
your business needs, the Business Approvals Kit for Power Platform was created
as a collection of components and tools that are designed to help organizations
digitalize the process.

The kit covers some of the typical requirements in any organization such as:

-   Configuration of multi-stage approvals

-   Delegation

-   Approval history

-   Progress visibility

-   Out of office management

Although the underlying features and components used to build the kit (such as
Dataverse, admin APIs, and connectors) are fully supported, the kit itself
represents sample implementations of these features. Our customers and community
can use and customize these features to implement admin and governance
capabilities in their organizations.
