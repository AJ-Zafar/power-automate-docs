You'll need version 3.x.x or later to get the functionality that's described in the articles in this section.

## Change environments

You might have different environments to work in depending on the purpose of your work (for example, testing, projects, and customers). You can easily change your environment to access your flows, approvals, notifications, and more when you're working on your mobile device.

1. Open the Power Automate mobile app and sign in with either Azure Active Directory or your Microsoft account.

1. Select the environment icon, and then select the environment you want to access. A check mark appears next to the selected environment.

## Limitations

The Power Automate mobile app for Android has a few limitations:

- Geofencing, or using location-based triggers, isn't supported. This was formerly a preview feature.

- You can run flows in the mobile app, but not create or edit them. Customers told us that they prefer to create and edit their flows in Power Automate on the web. If you're on the go and need to create or edit a flow, open Power Automate in your mobile device's web browser.
