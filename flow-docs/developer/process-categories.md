# Process categories

Processes enable you to model real-life business processes, for example best practices or standard practices. When modeling your business practices, you can choose from four categories of processes:  

- **Workflow**. Use this process to model and automate real world business processes. These processes can be configured to run in the background or in real time and can optionally require user input. Workflow processes can start automatically based on specified conditions or can be started manually by a user.  

- **Action**. Use this process to create a new operation that is not available in a standard Common Data service (CDS) for Apps environment or to combine multiple disparate operations into a single operation. For example, in the case of a support call center, you could combine `create`, `assign`, and `setstate` operations into a single new “escalate” operation.  

- **Business process flow**. Use this process to create a visualization of the business process flow. Users are guided through various stages of the sales or customer service processes. At each stage, you complete specific steps and then move to the next stage.  You can customize the process flow by adding or removing steps, changing the order of the stages, or adding new entities to the process flow.  

- **Dialog**. Use this process to create an  interactive step-by-step data entry form that requires user input to start and run to completion. When you start the dialog process, a wizard-like interface is presented so you can make appropriate selections or enter data as you progress through each page of the wizard.  

There are three ways to create business processes: interactively through the web application forms and the workflow designer, by writing code that uses workflow related classes, and by importing a pre-made workflow in a solution. Because the SDK is developer-focused, we are covering the coding aspect of creating workflow processes.

## Differences between workflows and dialogs

The following table provides information about the differences between workflows and dialogs.

|                                  Are asynchronous or real-time processes, and do not require user input to run to completion.

|                  Triggers are supported for workflows.

## When to use a workflow instead of a plug-in

Most operations that can be accomplished by using workflows can also be accomplished by using plug-ins. However, you should use workflow processes instead of plug-ins when:  

- Changes in the business logic must be performed by people who are not developers, or the changes should not be dependent on the availability of a developer to do the work. When custom workflow activities are defined as Workflow .NET assemblies, a person who is not a developer can use Dynamics 365 to define the conditions when the custom actions are performed and the parameters that will be passed to the assembly.  

- You need the ability to let users apply your workflow logic manually. With workflow processes, users can trigger the processing of workflow rules by clicking **Run Workflow** on the form or from a grid.  

Use plug-ins when you need the best performance possible from your custom business logic. Plug-ins can start quicker and therefore typically run faster that even a real-time workflow. However, the benefit in performance may be outweighed by the ease of use in creating and maintaining workflows where only a non-developer, for example a business analyst, is required to do the work.  

For more information about plug-ins, see [Write plug-ins to extend business processes](write-plugin-extend-business-processes.md).  

## Distributing workflows in solutions

You can include workflows and custom workflow activities in a solution that is imported into another CDS for Apps environment. However, if you refer to specific entity instances in a workflow and the workflow is moved into another system, problems will arise because the unique IDs of the entity instances in the workflow will differ from those in the target system.  Dynamics 365 automatically resolves system user and currency entity records based on the full name property, but it won't automatically resolve records for other entity types.
