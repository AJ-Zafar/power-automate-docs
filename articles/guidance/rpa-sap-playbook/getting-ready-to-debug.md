# Getting ready to debug

Before we continue with the primary flow in the Power Automat portal, let's test run our flow in by **temporarily** assigning a **default value** to the variables defined earlier.

1.  In the Variables pane, select the **â€¦** next to the **AddressType** variable name and then **Edit.**

2.  Enter a **Default value** (e.g. 2 for Temporary Address) and select **Update**.

3.  Repeat steps 1-2 for the **other 11** variables as well.

4.  Select **Save**, close the confirmation dialog, and then select **Run**.

This will execute your flow. If you run into an error during execution, make sure you observe the error status bar in the lower part of the Power Automate Desktop designer and apply the appropriate fix.

**IMPORTANT:** Delete all previously defined default values before you leave the Desktop flow authoring experience in Power Automate Desktop!
