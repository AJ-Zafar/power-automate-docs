# Low-code RPA with SAP GUI in Power Automate Desktop

<!--todo: there are no 4 samples in the linked doc-->
<!--note from editor: The "4" referred to the chapter number in the e-book (which I renamed, so if you reject that change, be sure to change it here and elsewhere in the doc set).-->

With the addition of Power Automate Desktop, it's quicker and easier to develop low-code SAP GUI automations. You can use Power Automate Desktop to build from simple to highly sophisticated end-to-end automations. To showcase this, we'll perform the steps outlined in [Sample SAP GUI automation for this tutorial](sample-sap-scenario.md) by using Power Automate Desktop actions. We’ll do some minor tweaks afterward in the designer. To make our automation dynamic, first we'll need to create some variables that we'll use to fill in data—like street, city, and country—and also system variables to connect to your SAP system.

Follow along in the low-code approach in the video series:
