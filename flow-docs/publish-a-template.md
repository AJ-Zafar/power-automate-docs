# Submit a template to the Microsoft Flow gallery

Submit a flow template to the gallery of templates for Microsoft Flow. Templates help people not only to create flows more easily but also to imagine additional scenarios that would benefit from a flow.

1. On the **My Flows** page, select the ellipsis (...) for a flow.

    ![Ellipsis button](./media/publish-a-template/ellipsis-button.png)
1. Select **Details** in the menu that appears.
1. Select **More**, and then select **Submit as a template** in the menu that appears.

    ![Context menu](./media/publish-a-template/context-menu.png)
    >[!NOTE]>  You can only submit flows that have run successfully at least once since the last save:

     ![Ellipsis button](./media/publish-a-template/need-successful-run-warning.png)
1. Specify a meaningful title, a clear description of the scenario that your template will help automate, the biggest benefit, the number of users, number of runs, and the categories that apply for the template.

    ![Template options](./media/publish-a-template/template-options.png)
1. Select **Submit**.

     The Microsoft Flow team verifies and *possibly modifies* your template. If the team approves your template, it appears in the gallery of templates for Microsoft Flow.
